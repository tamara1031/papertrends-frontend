The groundbreaking work of\nWilliams and Beer has shown that this decomposition cannot be determined from\nclassic information theory without making additional assumptions, and several\ncandidate measures have been proposed, often drawing on principles from related\nfields such as decision theory. None of these measures is differentiable with\nrespect to the underlying probability mass function. We here present a novel\nmeasure that satisfies this property, emerges solely from information-theoretic\nprinciples, and has the form of a local mutual information. We show how the\nmeasure can be understood from the perspective of exclusions of probability\nmass, a principle that is foundational to the original definition of the mutual\ninformation by Fano. Since our measure is well-defined for individual\nrealizations of the random variables it lends itself for example to local\nlearning in artificial neural networks. We also show that it has a meaningful\nM\\\"{o}bius inversion on a redundancy lattice and obeys a target chain rule. We\ngive an operational interpretation of the measure based on the decisions that\nan agent should take if given only the shared information.",

Such methods do not generalize well\nwhen applied to multivariate, multi-source, state-varying, and noisy\ntime-series data. To address these issues, we propose a highly generalizable\nmethod that uses information theory-based features to identify and learn from\npatterns in multivariate time-series data. To demonstrate the proposed\napproach, we analyze pattern changes in human activity data. For applications\nwith stochastic state transitions, features are developed based on Shannon's\nentropy of Markov chains, entropy rates of Markov chains, entropy production of\nMarkov chains, and von Neumann entropy of Markov chains. For applications where\nstate modeling is not applicable, we utilize five entropy variants, including\napproximate entropy, increment entropy, dispersion entropy, phase entropy, and\nslope entropy. The results show the proposed information theory-based features\nimprove the recall rate, F1 score, and accuracy on average by up to 23.01%\ncompared with the baseline models and a simpler model structure, with an\naverage reduction of 18.75 times in the number of model parameters.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning systems have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformances in many applications, and a key is the existence of well trained\nclassifiers on benchmark datasets. As a main-stream loss function, the cross\nentropy can easily lead us to find models which demonstrate severe overfitting\nbehavior. In this paper, we show that the existing cross entropy loss\nminimization problem essentially learns the label conditional entropy (CE) of\nthe underlying data distribution of the dataset. However, the CE learned in\nthis way does not characterize well the information shared by the label and the\ninput. In this paper, we propose a mutual information learning framework where\nwe train deep neural network classifiers via learning the mutual information\nbetween the label and the input. Theoretically, we give the population\nclassification error lower bound in terms of the mutual information. In\naddition, we derive the mutual information lower and upper bounds for a\nconcrete binary classification data model in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and also the error\nprobability lower bound in this scenario. Empirically, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets to support our theory. The mutual\ninformation learned classifiers (MILCs) achieve far better generalization\nperformances than the conditional entropy learned classifiers (CELCs) with an\nimprovement which can exceed more than 10\\% in testing accuracy.",

          "abstract": "In next-generation wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are foreseeable to\nsupport a large number of antennas at the transceiver as well as a large number\nof reflecting elements at the RIS. To fully unleash the potential of RIS, the\nphase shifts of RIS elements should be carefully designed, resulting in a\nhigh-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that is hard to solve. In this\npaper, we address this scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces,\nso as to optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity.\nSpecifically, each subsurface employs a linear phase variation structure to\nanomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired direction, and the sizes\nof sub-surfaces can be adaptively adjusted according to channel conditions. We\nformulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit covariance matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Under the RIS partitioning\nframework, the RIS phase shifts optimization reduces to the manipulation of the\nsub-surface sizes, the phase gradients of sub-surfaces, and the common phase\nshifts of sub-surfaces. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the\nsystem with an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and RIS\nelements. The asymptotic analysis provides useful insights on the understanding\nof the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoff in RIS partitioning design.\nWe show that in the asymptotic domain, the achievable rate maximization problem\nhas a rather simple form. We develop an efficient algorithm to find an\napproximate optimal solution via a 1D grid search. By applying the asymptotic\nresult to a finite-size system with necessary modifications, we show by\nnumerical results that the proposed design achieves a favorable tradeoff\nbetween system performance and computational complexity.",

To fully exploit the benefits of RIS, in this paper, we introduce\nRIS 2.0 beyond diagonal phase shift matrices, namely beyond diagonal RIS\n(BD-RIS). We first explain the modeling of BD-RIS based on the scattering\nparameter network analysis and classify BD-RIS by the mathematical\ncharacteristics of the scattering matrix, supported modes, and architectures.\nThen, we provide simulations to evaluate the sum-rate performance with\ndifferent modes/architectures of BD-RIS. We summarize the benefits of BD-RIS in\nproviding high flexibility in wave manipulation, enlarging coverage,\nfacilitating the deployment, and requiring low complexity in resolution bit and\nelement numbers.

          "abstract": "One-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) is an extreme-quantized signal acquisition\nmethod that has been intermittently studied in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear\nsamples of a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample\n(sign of the measurement). The extreme quantization makes it an interesting\ncase study of the more general single-index or generalized linear models. At\nthe same time it can also be thought of as a `design' version of learning a\nbinary linear classifier or halfspace-learning.\n  Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS\neither aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal within\nan $\\epsilon$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which often\nalso computationally facilitate approximate signal recovery. A \\emph{universal}\nmeasurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work\n\\emph{for all} sparse signals. With universality, it is known that\n$\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS measurements are necessary and sufficient for\nsupport recovery (where $k$ denotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that\nit is possible to universally recover the support with a small number of false\npositives with $\\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the\nsignal vector is known, then with a different technique, this result can be\nimproved to only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ measurements.

Furthermore, for the non-Gaussian noise scenario,\nwe further explore it and give the corresponding result. The simulation\nexperiments conducted, on the one hand show effect of noise variance on\nrecovery performance, on the other hand demonstrate the verifiability of the\nproposed model.",

          "abstract": "This paper considers the multiaccess coded caching systems formulated by\nHachem et al., including a central server containing $N$ files connected to $K$\ncache-less users through an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache-nodes, each\nequipped with a cache memory size of $M$ files. Each user has access to $L$\nneighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching\nscheme proposed by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that $L$ does not divide\n$K$, where the needed number of transmissions (a.k.a. load) is at most four\ntimes the load expression for the case where $L$ divides $K$.\n  Our main contribution is to propose a novel {\\it transformation} approach to\nsmartly extend the schemes satisfying some conditions for the well known\nshared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching systems. Then we can get\nmany coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess\ncoded caching system. These resulting schemes have the maximum local caching\ngain (i.e., the cached contents stored at any $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes are\ndifferent such that the number of retrieval packets by each user from the\nconnected cache-nodes is maximal) and the same coded caching gain as the\noriginal schemes. Applying the transformation approach to the well-known\nshared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we obtain a\nnew multiaccess coded caching scheme that achieves the same load as the scheme\nof Hachem et al. but for any system parameters. Under the constraint of the\ncache placement used in this new multiaccess coded caching scheme, our delivery\nstrategy is approximately optimal when $K$ is sufficiently large. Finally, we\nalso show that the transmission load of the proposed scheme can be further\nreduced by compressing the multicast message.",

This paper provides a tutorial overview on UAV-enabled WPT and its\nappealing applications, in particular focusing on how to exploit UAVs'\ncontrollable mobility via their 3D trajectory design to maximize the amounts of\nenergy transferred to all GDs in a wireless network with fairness. First, we\nconsider the single-UAV-enabled WPT scenario with one UAV wirelessly charging\nmultiple GDs at known locations. To solve the energy maximization problem in\nthis case, we present a general trajectory design framework consisting of three\ninnovative approaches to optimize the UAV trajectory, which are multi-location\nhovering, successive-hover-and-fly, and time-quantization-based optimization,\nrespectively. Next, we consider the multi-UAV-enabled WPT scenario where\nmultiple UAVs cooperatively charge many GDs in a large area. Building upon the\nsingle-UAV trajectory design, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly\noptimize multiple UAVs' trajectories, based on the principles of UAV swarming\nand GD clustering, respectively.

FL allows the clients to participate\nin the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their\nlocal data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead,\nwhere the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central\nserver at each global training round.

A major challenge of SWIPT is the\nenergy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive\nlow-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and\nenergy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the\nreceived RF signal is first rectified before being used for information\ndecoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF\ncomponents such as local oscillators and mixers.

The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the\nPeak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's\nnonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the\ninformation can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the\nposition of the pulse in a certain symbol duration.

          "abstract": "This paper considers a Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap\nchannel with a legitimate transmitter, a legitimate receiver (Bob), an\neavesdropper (Eve), and a cooperative jammer. All nodes may be equipped with\nmultiple antennas. Traditionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN) to\nenhance the security. However, using this approach, the jamming signal\ninterferes not only with Eve but also with Bob. In this paper, besides the GN\nstrategy, we assume that the jammer can also choose to use the encoded jammer\n(EJ) strategy, i.e., instead of GN, it transmits a codeword from an appropriate\ncodebook. In certain conditions, the EJ scheme enables Bob to decode the\njamming codeword and thus cancel the interference, while Eve remains unable to\ndo so even if it knows all the codebooks. We first derive an inner bound on the\nsystem's secrecy rate under the strong secrecy metric, and then consider the\nmaximization this bound through precoder design in a computationally efficient\nmanner. In the single-input multi-output (SIMO) case, we prove that although\nnon-convex, the power control problems can be optimally solved for both GN and\nEJ schemes. In the MIMO case, we propose to solve the problems using the matrix\nsimultaneous diagonalization (SD) technique, which requires quite a low\ncomputational complexity. Simulation results show that by introducing a\ncooperative jammer with coding capability, and allowing it to switch between\nthe GN and EJ schemes, a dramatic increase in the secrecy rate can be achieved.\nIn addition, the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the current\nstate of the art benchmarks in terms of both secrecy rate and computation time.",

          "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) emerges as a paradigm to achieve ubiquitous\nconnectivity via wireless communications between kinds of physical objects. Due\nto the wireless broadcasting nature and the energy constraint of physical\nobjects, concerns on IoT security have triggered research on cooperative\njamming based physical layer security. With the help of a cooperative jammer,\nexisting solutions can effectively fight against eavesdroppers. However, these\nschemes are of high energy cost due to continuously transmitting jamming\nsignals. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose a new idea of\nintermittent jamming and design five specific intermittent jamming schemes\n(IJSs). By taking the transmit frame formate into account, we optimize these\nIJSs from three aspects, including the jamming power, the jamming method, and\nthe jamming positions. Then we analyze the applicability of the proposed IJSs\naccording to different requirements on the synchronization, the available\njamming energy and the jamming power constraints. Extensive MATLAB experiments\nare conducted on the basis of the WLAN Toolbox, which demonstrate the proposed\nIJSs can effectively degrade the reception of the eavesdropper and outperform\nthe widespread continuous jamming scheme (CJS) when the available jamming\nenergy is limited.",

          "year": "2024-05",
          "abstract": "Physical layer security (PLS) technology based on the fixed-position antenna\n(FPA) has {attracted widespread attention}. Due to the fixed feature of the\nantennas, current FPA-based PLS schemes cannot fully utilize the spatial degree\nof freedom, and thus a weaken secure gain in the desired/undesired direction\nmay exist. Different from the concept of FPA, mobile antenna (MA) is a novel\ntechnology that {reconfigures} the wireless channels and enhances the\ncorresponding capacity through the flexible movement of antennas on a minor\nscale. MA-empowered PLS enjoys huge potential and deserves further\ninvestigation. In this paper, we, for the first time, investigate the secrecy\nperformance of MA-enabled PLS system where a MA-based Alice transmits the\nconfidential information to multiple single-antenna Bobs, in the presence of\nthe single-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) {in the absence} of perfect channel state\ninformation (CSI). For the purpose of the secrecy rate maximization of the\nworst Bob, we jointly design the transmit beamforming and antenna positions at\nthe Alice, subject to the minimum moving distance of the antenna, uncertainty\nCSI of Eve, and maximum transmit power. Furthermore, the projected gradient\nascent (PGA), alternating optimization (AO), and simulated annealing (SA) {are}\nadopted to solve the non-convex characteristics of the problem of the secrecy\nrate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and\ncorrectness of the proposed method. In particular, MA-enabled PLS scheme can\nsignificantly enhance the secrecy rate compared to the conventional FPA-based\nones for different settings of key system parameters.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the security enhancement of an intelligent reflecting\nsurface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where a\ndistributed IRS enabled NOMA transmission framework is proposed to serve users\nsecurely in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Considering that\neavesdropper's instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is challenging to\nacquire in practice, we utilize secrecy outage probability (SOP) as the\nsecurity metric. A problem of maximizing the minimum secrecy rate among users,\nsubject to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding constraints\nand SOP constraints, by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming at the BS and\nphase shifts of IRSs, is formulated. For special case with a single-antenna BS,\nwe derive the exact closed-form SOP expressions and propose a novel\nring-penalty based successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to design\npower allocation and phase shifts jointly. While for the more general and\nchallenging case with a multi-antenna BS, we adopt the Bernstein-type\ninequality to approximate the SOP constraints by a deterministic convex form.\nTo proceed, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed\nto solve the considered problem. Numerical results validate the advantages of\nthe proposed algorithms over the baseline schemes. Particularly, two\ninteresting phenomena on distributed IRS deployment are revealed: 1) the\nsecrecy rate peak is achieved only when distributed IRSs share the reflecting\nelements equally; and 2) the distributed IRS deployment does not always\noutperform the centralized IRS deployment, due to the tradeoff between the\nnumber of IRSs and the reflecting elements equipped at each IRS.",

Existing researches ignore the\nproblem that secrecy rate can not be calculated if the eavesdropper's\ninstantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unknown. Furthermore, without\nthe secrecy rate expression, beamforming and phase shifter optimization with\nthe purpose of PLS enhancement is not available. To address these problems, we\nfirst give the expression of secrecy outage probability for any beamforming\nvector and phase shifter matrix as the RIS-assisted PLS metric, which is\nmeasured based on the eavesdropper's statistical CSI. Then, with the aid of the\nexpression, we formulate the minimization problem of secrecy outage probability\nthat is solved via alternately optimizing beamforming vectors and phase shift\nmatrices. In the case of single-antenna transmitter or single-antenna\nlegitimate receiver, the proposed alternating optimization (AO) scheme can be\nsimplified to reduce computational complexity.

          "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted\nGuassian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel (WTC), and focus\non enhancing its secrecy rate. Due to MIMO setting, all the existing solutions\nfor enhancing the secrecy rate over multiple-input single-output WTC completely\nfall to this work. Furthermore, all the existing studies are simply based on an\nideal assumption that full channel state information (CSI) of eavesdropper (Ev)\nis available. Therefore, we propose numerical solutions to enhance the secrecy\nrate of this channel under both full and no Ev's CSI cases. For the full CSI\ncase, we propose a barrier method and one-by-one (OBO) optimization combined\nalternating optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit\ncovariance R at transmitter (Tx) and phase shift coefficient Q at IRS. For the\ncase of no Ev's CSI, we develop an artificial noise (AN) aided joint\ntransmission scheme to enhance the secrecy rate. In this scheme, a bisection\nsearch (BS) and OBO optimization combined AO algorithm is proposed to jointly\noptimize R and Q. Such scheme is also applied to enhance the secrecy rate under\na special scenario in which the direct link between Tx and receiver/Ev is\nblocked due to obstacles. In particular, we propose a BS and\nminorization-maximization (MM) combined AO algorithm with slightly faster\nconvergence to optimize R and Q for this scenario. Simulation results have\nvalidated the monotonic convergence of the proposed algorithms, and it is shown\nthat the proposed algorithms for the IRS-assisted design achieve significantly\nlarger secrecy rate than the other benchmark schemes under full CSI. When Ev's\nCSI is unknown, the secrecy performance of this channel also can be enhanced by\nthe proposed AN aided scheme, and there is a trade-off between increasing the\nquality of service at Rx and enhancing the secrecy rate.",

First, we\nidentify the key themes and forces driving the development of 6G, and what will\nmake 6G unique. We argue that 6G requirements and system design will be driven\nby (i) the tenacious pursuit of spectral (bits/Hz/area), energy (bits/Joule),\nand cost (bits/dollar) efficiencies, and (ii) three new service enhancements:\nsensing/localization/awareness, compute, and global broadband/emergency\nconnectivity. Second, we overview the important role of spectrum in 6G, what\nnew spectrum to expect in 6G, and outline how the different bands will be used\nto provide 6G services. Third, we focus our attention on the 6G physical layer,\nincluding waveforms, MIMO advancements, and the potential use of deep learning.\nFinally, we explore how global connectivity will be achieved in 6G, through\nnon-terrestrial networks as well as low-cost network expansion via\ndisaggregation and O-RAN.

Thorough experiments and ray tracing-based\ncomputer simulations verify that the proposed angle-based SLAM can achieve\nsub-meter level localization and mapping accuracy with a single base station\nand without the requirement of strict time synchronization.
