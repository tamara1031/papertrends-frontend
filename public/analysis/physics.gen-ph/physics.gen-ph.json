This revelation\nfacilitates the expansion of Dirac's space-time algebra to Clifford algebra\nCl(0,6). The resultant rich geometric structure can be leveraged to establish a\ncombined framework of the standard model and gravity, wherein a gravi-weak\ninteraction between the extended vierbein field and the extended weak gauge\nfield is allowed. In conjunction with the composite Higgs model, we examine the\nvierbein field as a Cooper-pair-like fermion-antifermion condensation. Quantum\ngravity is realized indirectly via the quantized standard model spinor fields\nwhich underlie the composite space-time metric. We propose that the fundamental\nenergy scales of the universe including the Planck scale are emergent and\nresulted from quantum condensations, thus possibly addressing the cosmological\nconstant problem through an unconventional multi-scale renormalization\nprocedure for multiplications of divergent Feynman integrals. The Clifford\nalgebra approach also permits a weaker form of charge conjugation without\nparticle-antiparticle interchange, leading to a Majorana-type mass that\nconserves lepton number. Additionally, with reshuffling the traditional\nquark-lepton pairing pattern of three generations of fermions, we explore a\nthree-Higgs-doublet model with Higgs VEVs 246 GeV, 42 GeV and 2.5 GeV which\ncould explain the mass hierarchies of fermions.",

          "abstract": "Fifty years ago the standard model offered an elegant new step towards\nunderstanding elementary fermion and boson fields, making several assumptions,\nsuggested by experiments. The assumptions are still waiting for an explanation.\nThere are many proposals in the literature for the next step. The\nspin-charge-family theory of one of us (N.S.M.B.) is offering the explanation\nfor not only all by the standard model assumed properties of quarks and leptons\nand antiquarks and antileptons, with the families included, of the vectors\ngauge fields, of the Higgs's scalar and Yukawa couplings, but also for the\nsecond quantization postulates of Dirac and for cosmological observations, like\nthere are the appearance of the dark matter, of matter-antimatter asymmetry,\nmaking several predictions. This theory proposes a simple starting action in $\nd\\ge (13+1)$ space with fermions interacting with the gravity only, what\nmanifests in $d=(3+1)$ as the vector and scalar gauge fields, and uses the odd\nClifford algebra objects to describe the internal space of fermions, what\nenables that the creation and annihilation operators for fermions fulfill the\nanticommutation relations for the second quantized fields without Dirac's\npostulates: Fermions single particle states already anticommute. We present in\nthis review article a short overview of the spin-charge-family theory,\nillustrating shortly on the toy model the breaks of the starting symmetries in\n$d=(13+1)$ space, which are triggered either by scalar fields -- the vielbeins\nwith the space index belonging to $d>(3+1)$ -- or by the condensate of the two\nright handed neutrinos, with the family quantum number not belonging to the\nobserved families.

The action of quantum measurement, leading the superposition state\nof the measured quantum system into a definite output state, not only\nreconciles contradictions between quantum and classical mechanics but also\nfacilitates quantum state manipulations, including reading and resetting.\nDespite its significance, four fundamental issues -- randomness,\ninstantaneousness, irreversibility, and preferred-basis -- continue to pose\nsignificant challenges to the broader application of quantum measurement and\nour overall understanding of quantum mechanics. In this work, we employ a new\nspace-time approach to relativistic quantum mechanics to address these issues\nsystematically. Our approach provides a comprehensive elucidation of the\nintricate connections between quantum measurement and quantum unitary\nevolution, as well as an in-depth analysis for the interdependence of non-local\ncorrelations and relativistic theories.

In the paper, the field strength and angular momentum in the vacuum can\nbe combined together to become one new physical quantity, that is, the\ncomposite field strength within the material media. Substituting the latter for\nthe field strength in the vacuum will deduce the field equations within\nmaterial media, including the electromagnetic and gravitational equations in\nthe presence of some material media. In terms of the electromagnetic fields,\nthe electromagnetic equations in the presence of some electromagnetic media are\nable to explore a few new physical properties of electromagnetic media.\nEspecially, in case the magnetic flux density and magnetization intensity both\nfluctuate at a single-frequency, their frequencies must be identical to each\nother within electromagnetic media. In some extreme cases, the electromagnetic\nequations within electromagnetic media will be degenerated into the Maxwell's\nequations in the vacuum. The above reveals that the electromagnetic equations\nwithin electromagnetic media are capable of extending the scope of application\nof electromagnetic theory. For the gravitational fields, there are some similar\ninferences and conclusions within gravitational media. Further they can be\nutilized to research the frequencies of astrophysical jets.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental belief is that the formulism of relativistic quantum mechanics\nequations (RQMEs) should remain in low momentum motion. However, it is found\nthat some formulas from RQMEs were lost in Schr\\\"odinger equation. For example,\na free relativistic particle has positive and negative energy branches. The\nformer includes positive kinetic energy (PKE) and the latter negative kinetic\nenergy (NKE). The latter should be treated on an equal footing as the former.\nNevertheless, from Schr\\\"odinger equation, a free particle can have only PKE.\nStarting from RQMEs and taking low momentum approximation, we derive NKE\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which is for the cases that free particles have NKE.\nThus negative energy branch of RQMEs can be retained in low momentum motion. We\npoint out a fact that whether Schr\\\"odinger equation is applicable in a region\nwhere a particle's energy E is less than potential V, E<V, has never been\nquantitatively verified. In such a region NKE Schr\\\"odinger equation should be\nemployed. With the help of NKE Schr\\\"odinger equation, the lost formulas are\nrecovered. The so-called difficulty of negative probability of Klein-Gordon\nequation for free particles is solved. A PKE (NKE) particle can have stationary\nmotion only when it is subject to an attractive (repulsive) potential, which is\ndetermined by Virial theorem. Two NKE electrons in a potential can constitute a\nstablesystem, a new kind of possible mechanism for electron paring. The whole\ndiscussion stems from RQMEs with no any new postulation.
