The new\nstructure constants of the extended operator algebra consist of one-point\nfunctions of local operators which are nonvanishing due to the defect insertion\nand carry nontrivial coupling dependence. We study an important class of\nhalf-BPS superconformal defects engineered by D5 branes that share three common\ndirections with the D3 branes and involve Nahm pole configurations for the SYM\nfields on the D3 brane worldvolume. In the planar large $N$ limit, we obtain\nnon-perturbative results in the 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda$ for the defect\none-point functions of both BPS and non-BPS operators, building upon recent\nprogress in localization and integrability methods. For BPS operator insertions\nin the SYM with D5-brane type boundary or interface, we derive an effective two\ndimensional defect-Yang-Mills (dYM) theory from supersymmetric localization,\nwhich gives an efficient way to extract defect observables and generates a\nnovel matrix model for the defect one-point function. By solving the matrix\nmodel in the large $N$ limit, we obtain exact results in $\\lambda$ which\ninterpolate between perturbative Feynman diagram contributions in the weak\ncoupling limit and IIB string theory predictions on $AdS_5\\times S^5$ in the\nstrong coupling regime, providing a precision test of AdS/CFT with interface\ndefects. For general non-BPS operators, we develop a non-perturbative\nbootstrap-type program for integrable boundary states on the worldsheet of the\nIIB string theory, corresponding to the interface defects in the planar SYM.\nSuch integrable boundary states are constrained by a set of general consistency\nconditions for which we present explicit solutions that reproduce and extend\nthe known results at weak coupling from integrable spin-chain methods.",

We formulate and prove several recent\npredictions from the physics literature in this language:\n  We recall the Coulomb branch construction of [BFN1] from this perspective. We\nprove a conjecture from [CosG] that the Coulomb branch factorization\n$\\mathbb{E}_1$ algebra $\\mathcal{A}(G,N)$ acts on the factorization algebra of\nchiral differential operators $\\mathcal{D}^{ch}(Y)$ on the quotient stack\n$Y=N/G$.

Quantum field theory achieves this through the process of\nrenormalisation, but famously, perturbative quantum gravity fails to be\nrenormalisable, even without coupling to matter. Recently, an alternative to\nquantum gravity has been proposed, in which the geometry of spacetime is taken\nto be classical rather than quantum, while still being coupled to quantum\nmatter fields [1, 2]. This can be done consistently, provided the dynamics is\nfundamentally stochastic. Here, we find that the pure gravity theory is\nformally renormalisable. We do so via the path integral formulation by relating\nthe classical-quantum action to that of quadratic gravity which is\nrenormalisable. Because the action induces stochastic dynamics of space-time,\nrather than deterministic evolution of a quantum field, the classical-quantum\ntheory is free of tachyons and negative norm ghosts. The key remaining question\nis whether the renormalisation prescription retains completely positive (CP)\ndynamics. This consideration appears to single out the scale invariant and\nasymptotically free theory. We give further evidence that the theory is CP, by\nshowing that the two-point function of the scalar mode is positive.

According to\ngeneral relativity, black holes have a horizon that hides a singularity where\nEinstein's theory breaks down. Recently, gravitational waves opened the\npossibility to probe the existence of horizons and investigate the nature of\ncompact objects. This is of particular interest given some quantum-gravity\nmodels which predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact\nobjects. Such exotic compact objects can emit a different gravitational-wave\nsignal relative to the black hole case. In this thesis, we analyze the\nstability of horizonless compact objects, and derive a generic framework to\ncompute their characteristic oscillation frequencies. We provide an analytical,\nphysically-motivated template to search for the gravitational-wave echoes\nemitted by these objects in the late-time postmerger signal. Finally, we infer\nhow extreme mass-ratio inspirals observable by future gravitational-wave\ndetectors will allow for model-independent tests of the black hole paradigm.",

          "abstract": "The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to\nprovide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of\nblack hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in\nwhich a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black\nhole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the\nstrong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general\nrelativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar\nfields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the\ninspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that\npresent both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters\naffect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave\nsignal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in\nparticular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing\nricher waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic\ncase. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides\na more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs\nwith such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently\nconstraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational\nwave observations.",

Advancing our methods for evaluating Feynman integrals will,\ntherefore, strengthen our ability to compare theoretical predictions with data\nfrom particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Motivated by\nthis, the present manuscript purports to study mathematical concepts related to\nFeynman integrals. In particular, we present both numerical and analytical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of Feynman integrals.\n  The content is divided into three parts. Part I focuses on the method of DEQs\nfor evaluating Feynman integrals. An otherwise daunting integral expression is\nthereby traded for the comparatively simpler task of solving a system of DEQs.\nWe use this technique to evaluate a family of two-loop Feynman integrals of\nrelevance for dark matter detection. Part II situates the study of DEQs for\nFeynman integrals within the framework of D-modules, a natural language for\nstudying PDEs algebraically. Special emphasis is put on a particular D-module\ncalled the GKZ system, a set of higher-order PDEs that annihilate a generalized\nversion of a Feynman integral. In the course of matching the generalized\nintegral to a Feynman integral proper, we discover an algorithm for evaluating\nthe latter in terms of logarithmic series. Part III develops a numerical\nintegration algorithm. It combines Monte Carlo sampling with tropical geometry,\na particular offspring of algebraic geometry that studies \"piecewise-linear\"\npolynomials. Feynman's i*epsilon-prescription is incorporated into the\nalgorithm via contour deformation. We present an open-source program named\nFeyntrop that implements this algorithm, and use it to numerically evaluate\nFeynman integrals between 1-5 loops and 0-5 legs in physical regions of phase\nspace.",

          "abstract": "We study the radiative process of two entangled two-level atoms uniformly\naccelerated in a thermal bath, coupled to a massless scalar field. First, using\nthe positive frequency Wightman function from the Minkowski modes with a\nRindler transformation we provide the transition probabilities for the\ntransitions from maximally entangled symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states\nto the collective excited state in $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensions. We observe a\npossible case of \\emph{anti-Unruh-like} event in these transition\nprobabilities, though the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensional results are not\ncompletely equivalent. We infer that thermal bath plays a major role in the\noccurrence of the anti-Unruh-like effect, as it is also present in the\ntransition probabilities corresponding to a single detector in this case.\nSecond, we have considered the Green's functions in terms of the Rindler modes\nwith the vacuum of Unruh modes for estimating the same. Here the anti-Unruh\neffect appears only for the transition from the anti-symmetric state to the\ncollective excited state. It is noticed that here the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$\ndimensional results are equivalent, and for a single detector, we do not\nobserve any anti-Unruh effect. This suggests that the entanglement between the\nstates of the atoms is the main cause for the observed anti-Unruh effect in\nthis case. In going through the investigation, we find that the transition\nprobability for a single detector case is symmetric under the interchange\nbetween the thermal bath's temperature and the Unruh temperature for Rindler\nmode analysis; whereas this is not the case for Minkowski mode. We further\ncomment on whether this observation may shed light on the analogy between an\naccelerated observer and a real thermal bath. An elaborate investigation for\nthe classifications of our observed anti-Unruh effects is also thoroughly\ndemonstrated.",
