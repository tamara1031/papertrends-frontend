          "abstract": "The chemical composition of planets is inherited by the distribution of the\nvarious molecular species in the protoplanetary disk at thetime of their\nformation. As of today, only a handful of disks has been imaged in multiple\nspectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign\ndevoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we\nreport on new ALMA Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the\nembedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum emission reveals a dust\ndisk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as the\nprominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they\nremain undetected in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side\noutflow, we inferred that the disk emission is optically thick in the inner 50\nau. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from this inner\nregion and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and\nthe characterization of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from\nthe inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar.\nThe CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is\nobserved only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with\nprevious observations and the predictions of thermochemical disk models.\nFinally, we constrained the disk-integrated column density of all molecules. In\nparticular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller than 2, making\nthe methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio\navailable from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya).",

          "abstract": "We aim to estimate if structures, such as cavities, rings, and gaps, are\ncommon in disks around VLMS and to test models of structure formation in these\ndisks. We also aim to compare the radial extent of the gas and dust emission in\ndisks around VLMS, which can give us insight about radial drift. We studied six\ndisks around VLMS in the Taurus star-forming region using ALMA Band 7 ($\\sim\n340\\,$GHz) at a resolution of $\\sim0.1''$. The targets were selected because of\ntheir high disk dust content in their stellar mass regime. Our observations\nresolve the disk dust continuum in all disks. In addition, we detect the\n$^{12}$CO ($J=3-2$) emission line in all targets and $^{13}$CO ($J=3-2$) in\nfive of the six sources. The angular resolution allows the detection of dust\nsubstructures in three out of the six disks, which we studied by using\nUV-modeling. Central cavities are observed in the disks around stars MHO\\,6\n(M5.0) and CIDA\\,1 (M4.5), while we have a tentative detection of a\nmulti-ringed disk around J0433. Single planets of masses\n$0.1\\sim0.4\\,M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ would be required. The other three disks with no\nobserved structures are the most compact and faintest in our sample. The\nemission of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO is more extended than the dust continuum\nemission in all disks of our sample. When using the $^{12}$CO emission to\ndetermine the gas disk extension $R_{\\rm{gas}}$, the ratio of\n$R_{\\rm{gas}}/R_{\\rm{dust}}$ in our sample varies from 2.3 to 6.0, which is\nconsistent with models of radial drift being very efficient around VLMS in the\nabsence of substructures. Our observations do not exclude giant planet\nformation on the substructures observed. A comparison of the size and\nluminosity of VLMS disks with their counterparts around higher mass stars shows\nthat they follow a similar relation.",

          "abstract": "Transition disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to host massive\ncompanions. However, the disk structure inside the companion orbit and how\nmaterial flows toward an actively accreting star remain unclear. We present a\nhigh resolution continuum study of inner disks in the cavities of 38 transition\ndisks. Measurements of the dust mass from archival Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar\nproperties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of\nthe inner disk. An inner dust disk is detected in 18 of 38 disks in our sample.\nOf the 14 resolved disks, 9 are significantly misaligned with the outer disk.\nThe near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner\ndisk. The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is\nrecovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner\ndisks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is\nuncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of\nradial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\\alpha$ ($\\sim 10^{-3}$) disk,\nor a failure of the $\\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport\nand accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap,\nPDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred\ngas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample. We hypothesize that these\ninner disk properties and the detection of planets are due to the gap having\nonly been opened recently by young, actively accreting planets.",

          "abstract": "Binary systems exert a gravitational torque on misaligned discs orbiting\nthem, causing differential precession which may produce disc warping and\ntearing. While this is well understood for gas-only discs, misaligned\ncirumbinary discs of gas and dust have not been thoroughly investigated. We\nperform SPH simulations of misaligned gas and dust discs around binaries to\ninvestigate the different evolution of these two components. We choose two\ndifferent disc aspect ratios: A thin case for which the gas disc always breaks,\nand a thick one where a smooth warp develops throughout the disc. For each\ncase, we run simulations of five different dust species with different degrees\nof coupling with the gas component, varying in Stokes number from 0.002\n(strongly coupled dust) to 1000 (effectively decoupled dust). We report two new\nphenomena: First, large dust grains in thick discs pile up at the warp\nlocation, forming narrow dust rings, due to a difference in precession between\nthe gas and dust components. These pile ups do not form at gas pressure maxima,\nand hence are different from conventional dust traps. This effect is most\nevident for St ~ 10 - 100. Second, thin discs tear and break only in the gas,\nwhile dust particles with St > 10 form a dense dust trap due to the steep\npressure gradient caused by the break in the gas. We find that dust with St <\n0.02 closely follow the gas particles, for both thin and thick discs, with\nradial drift becoming noticeable only for the largest grains in this range.",

          "year": "2021-11",
          "abstract": "The streaming instability is one of the most promising pathways to the\nformation of planetesimals from pebbles. Understanding how this instability\noperates under realistic conditions expected in protoplanetary disks is\ntherefore crucial to assess the efficiency of planet formation. Contemporary\nmodels of protoplanetary disks show that magnetic fields are key to driving gas\naccretion through large-scale, laminar magnetic stresses. However, the effect\nof such magnetic fields on the streaming instability has not been examined in\ndetail. To this end, we study the stability of dusty, magnetized gas in a\nprotoplanetary disk. We find the streaming instability can be enhanced by\npassive magnetic torques and even persist in the absence of a global radial\npressure gradient. In this case, instability is attributed to the azimuthal\ndrift between dust and gas, unlike the classical streaming instability, which\nis driven by radial drift. This suggests that the streaming instability can\nremain effective inside dust-trapping pressure bumps in accreting disks. When a\nlive vertical field is considered, we find the magneto-rotational instability\ncan be damped by dust feedback, while the classic streaming instability can be\nstabilized by magnetic perturbations. We also find that Alfv\\'en waves can be\ndestabilized by dust-gas drift, but this instability requires nearly ideal\nconditions.

          "abstract": "Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of\ndust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is\na plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However,\nrecent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust\ngrains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution\nmodels that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more\nstrongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously\nanticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that\nenables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly\ndrifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly\ndrifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the\ntimescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial\nadvection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for\nthe transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion\nstructure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and\nradial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations\nconfirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when\nthe predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by\nMHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal\nformation from poorly sticky grains.",

Our results indicate\na trend similar to the 1D models, with a decrease in the planetary mass-loss\nrate for all systems when secondary ionisation is taken into account. The\nmass-loss rates are found to decrease by 48% for the least massive planet when\nsecondary ionisation is accounted for. We find nevertheless a decrease that is\nless pronounced in 2D than in 1D. We observe differences in the Ly-a profile\nbetween the different cases and significant asymmetries in all of them,\nespecially for the lower mass planets. Finally, we observe that stellar flares\ndo not affect the mass-loss rate because they act, in general, on a timescale\nthat is too short. We find velocities in the escaping atmosphere up to 100\nkm/s, with the gas moving away from the star, which could be the result of the\ninteraction with the stellar wind. Furthermore, we find that stellar flares\ngenerally occur on a timescale that is too short to have a visible impact on\nthe mass-loss rate of the atmosphere.",

For weaker stellar winds (lower ram pressure),\nthe reduction in planetary escape rate is very small. However, as the stellar\nwind becomes stronger, the interaction happens deeper in the planetary\natmosphere and, once this interaction occurs below the sonic surface of the\nplanetary outflow, further reduction in evaporation rates is seen. We classify\nthese regimes in terms of the geometry of the planetary sonic surface. \"Closed\"\nrefers to scenarios where the sonic surface is undisturbed, while \"open\" refers\nto those where the surface is disrupted.

For specific sets of the least\nactivity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times the\ninitial one, depending on the star.

We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the\ncorrelations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in\norder to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity. The\nproposed approach uses a general family of statistical breakpoint methods,\noften referred to as change point detection (CPD) algorithms; several\nimplementations of which are available in R and python.

          "abstract": "The Global Meteor Network (GMN) utilizes highly sensitive low-cost CMOS video\ncameras which run open-source meteor detection software on Raspberry Pi\ncomputers. Currently, over 450 GMN cameras in 30 countries are deployed. The\nmain goal of the network is to provide long-term characterization of the\nradiants, flux, and size distribution of annual meteor showers and outbursts in\nthe optical meteor mass range. The rapid 24-hour publication cycle the orbital\ndata will enhance the public situational awareness of the near-Earth meteoroid\nenvironment. The GMN also aims to increase the number of instrumentally\nobserved meteorite falls and the transparency of data reduction methods. A\nnovel astrometry calibration method is presented which allows decoupling of the\ncamera pointing from the distortion, and is used for frequent pointing\ncalibrations through the night. Using wide-field cameras\n($88^{\\circ}\\times48^{\\circ}$) with a limiting stellar magnitude of $+6.0 \\pm\n0.5$ at 25 frames per second, over 220,000 precise meteoroid orbits were\ncollected since December 2018 until June 2021. The median radiant precision of\nall computed trajectories is $0.47^{\\circ}$, $0.32^{\\circ}$ for $\\sim20\\%$ of\nmeteors which were observed from 4+ stations, a precision sufficient to measure\nphysical dispersions of meteor showers. All non-daytime annual established\nmeteor showers were observed during that time, including five outbursts. An\nanalysis of a meteorite-dropping fireball is presented which showed visible\nwake, fragmentation details, and several discernible fragments. It had spatial\ntrajectory fit errors of only ~40 m, which translated into the estimated\nradiant and velocity errors of 3 arc minutes and tens of meters per second.",

          "year": "2024-07",
          "abstract": "The increasing volume of space objects in Earth's orbit presents a\nsignificant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular,\naccurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of\nspace objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When\nperforming Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of\nnon-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational\nperturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of\nspacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the\nSGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are\nable to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine\nlearning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past\npositions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external\nsources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision\nephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the\nperiod of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and\ntime-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low\ncomputational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing\nfaster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space\nobjects.",

          "year": "2022-04",
          "abstract": "Over the several decades, the space debris at LEO has grown rapidly which had\ncaused a serious threat to the operating satellite in an orbit. To avoid the\nrisk of collision and protect the LEO environment, the space robotics ADR\nconcept has been continuously developed for over a decade to chase, capture,\nand deorbit space debris. This paper presents the designed small satellite with\ndual robotic manipulators. The small satellite is designed based on CubeSat\nstandards, which uses commercially available products in the market. In this\npaper, an approach is detailed for designing the controlled chase and deorbit\nmaneuver for a small satellite equipped with an RCS thruster. The maneuvers are\ncomprised of two phases, a. bringing the chaser satellite to the debris orbit\nand accelerating it to close proximity of 1m to the debris object by using the\nlow thrust RCS thruster, and b. Once captured, controlled deorbiting it to 250\nkm of altitude. A Hohmann transfer concept is used to move our chaser satellite\nfrom the lower orbit to the debris orbit by two impulsive burns. A number of\nthe scenarios are simulated, where one or more orbital elements are adjusted.\nFor more than one orbital elements adjustment, the DAG law and the Q law are\nutilized. These laws synthesize the three direction thrusts to the single\nthrust force for the controlled maneuver. The $\\Delta$V requirement at each\nmaneuver is determined by using the performance parameters of the RCS thruster\nintended for a small satellite. The results show that, for long term simulation\nof a chaser satellite maneuver to debris object, an optimum DAG law is most\nsuitable than the Q law, as it can handle the singularity behavior of the\norbital elements caused due by adjustment of one or more elements more\nefficiently.",

          "year": "2023-07",
          "abstract": "With the sustained rise in satellite deployment in Low Earth Orbits, the\ncollision risk from untracked space debris is also increasing. Often\nsmall-sized space debris (below 10 cm) are hard to track using the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. However, knowing such space debris' trajectory is\ncrucial to avoid future collisions. We present a Physics Informed Neural\nNetwork (PINN) - based approach for estimation of the trajectory of space\ndebris after a collision event between active satellite and space debris. In\nthis work, we have simulated 8565 inelastic collision events between active\nsatellites and space debris. Using the velocities of the colliding objects\nbefore the collision, we calculate the post-collision velocities and record the\nobservations. The state (position and velocity), coefficient of restitution,\nand mass estimation of un-tracked space debris after an inelastic collision\nevent along with the tracked active satellite can be posed as an optimization\nproblem by observing the deviation of the active satellite from the trajectory.\nWe have applied the classical optimization method, the Lagrange multiplier\napproach, for solving the above optimization problem and observed that its\nstate estimation is not satisfactory as the system is under-determined.\nSubsequently, we have designed Deep Neural network-based methods and Physics\nInformed Neural Network (PINN )based methods for solving the above optimization\nproblem. We have compared the performance of the models using root mean square\nerror (RMSE) and interquartile range of the predictions. It has been observed\nthat the PINN-based methods provide a better prediction for position, velocity,\nmass and coefficient of restitution of the space debris compared to other\nmethods.",
