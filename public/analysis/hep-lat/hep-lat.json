          "abstract": "With a focus on universal quantum computing for quantum simulation, and\nthrough the example of lattice gauge theories, we introduce rather general\nquantum algorithms that can efficiently simulate certain classes of\ninteractions consisting of correlated changes in multiple (bosonic and\nfermionic) quantum numbers with non-trivial functional coefficients. In\nparticular, we analyze diagonalization of Hamiltonian terms using a\nsingular-value decomposition technique, and discuss how the achieved diagonal\nunitaries in the digitized time-evolution operator can be implemented. The\nlattice gauge theory studied is the SU(2) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions\ncoupled to one flavor of staggered fermions, for which a complete\nquantum-resource analysis within different computational models is presented.\nThe algorithms are shown to be applicable to higher-dimensional theories as\nwell as to other Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The example chosen\nfurther demonstrates the importance of adopting efficient theoretical\nformulations: it is shown that an explicitly gauge-invariant formulation using\nloop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom simplifies the algorithms and\nlowers the cost compared with the standard formulations based on\nangular-momentum as well as the Schwinger-boson degrees of freedom. The\nloop-string-hadron formulation further retains the non-Abelian gauge symmetry\ndespite the inexactness of the digitized simulation, without the need for\ncostly controlled operations. Such theoretical and algorithmic considerations\nare likely to be essential in quantumly simulating other complex theories of\nrelevance to nature.",

          "abstract": "Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much\nattentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge\ntheories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories\nwith local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected\nHamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way\ntowards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate\nthis concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with\nspinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge\ntheory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a\nfluctuating dynamical $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can\nbe realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical\nand numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is\nconfinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge\ntheory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using\nthe concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy\nphysics.",

The entanglement structure of the resource SPT\nstate reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we\nexplicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining\nphase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the\nbulk, by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state\nobtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we\nconstruct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the\nmeasurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter\nfield (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge\ninvariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further\nconsider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for\nlattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive\nprecise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects\ncorresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as\nmeasurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess\ndifferent (symmetry-protected) topological orders.

This calculation can be\nexpressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator\n$G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion\nrelations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\\to\\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ\ncollaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is\ncalculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using\nexperimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the\nadvantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from\ndata-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent\nof $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of\nthe hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that\nFermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3\ncross-section data for $e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier\nexperimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP\ncontribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and\nsupports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the\nexperimental value for $a_\\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then\ndiscuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a\nmore accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an\nuncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven\napproaches on their own.",

          "abstract": "The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a\nchallenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on\nthe phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the\norder of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of light quark\nflavours. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out and extrapolate the\nchiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the\ncrossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge\ncoupling, the number of quark flavours, their masses, and the lattice spacing.\nLattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for each $N_f <\n8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^\\text{tric}(N_f)$, at which\nthe chiral transition changes from first order ($a>a^\\text{tric}$) to second\norder ($a<a^\\text{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is merely a lattice\nartifact and not connected to the continuum.

By systematically calculating the coefficients of the hopping\nparameter expansion up to a high order of HPE at finite chemical potential, we\nfind that the higher order terms are strongly correlated with the Polyakov\nloop, which is the leading-order term, on each configuration. Moreover, their\ncomplex phases themselves, which are important at finite density, are also\nfound to be strongly correlated with the complex phase of the Polyakov loop.\nUsing this property, we develop a method for estimating the critical point\nincorporating high-order terms from calculations with only low-order terms. We\nreport that the first-order phase transition region in the heavy-quark region\nbecomes narrower exponentially with increasing the chemical potential. Since\nthe hopping parameter of the critical point decreases exponentially as the\ndensity increases, the sign problem does not become serious even when the\ndensity increases, and critical points can be evaluated up to high densities.",

In the\nheavy quark region of QCD, we have another first-order phase transition region\naround the heavy quark limit at zero density. By numerical simulations of\neffective heavy quark QCD, we found that, the first-order transition at zero\ndensity turns into a crossover as the chemical potential is increased, but,\nwhen we increase the chemical potential further, the change in the plaquette\nvalue near the crossover point becomes much steeper. This may be suggesting\nreappearance of the first-order phase transition. In this talk, we first show\nthe nature of the phase transition of phase-quenched finite density QCD in the\nheavy quark region and then study the effect of the complex phase to discuss\nwhether the QCD phase transition changes again to a first-order phase\ntransition at very high densities.",

It achieves this goal by utilizing\nthe Yang--Mills gradient flow or diffusion for the block-spin process. In this\npaper, we formulate GFERG by the Reuter equation in which the block spinning is\ndone by Gaussian integration. This formulation provides a simple understanding\nof various points of GFERG, unresolved thus far. First, there exists a unique\nordering of functional derivatives in the GFERG equation that remove ambiguity\nof contact terms. Second, perturbation theory of GFERG suffers from\nunconventional ultraviolet (UV) divergences if no gauge fixing is introduced.\nThis explains the origin of some UV divergences we have encountered in\nperturbative solutions to GFERG. Third, the modified correlation functions\ncalculated with the Wilson action in GFERG coincide with the correlation\nfunctions of diffused or flowed fields calculated with the bare action. This\nshows the existence of a Wilson action that reproduces precisely the physical\nquantities computed by the gradient flow formalism (up to contact terms). We\nobtain a definite ERG interpretation of the gradient flow.
