However, calculation of such a quantity is nearly impossible in\nexperiments as the length scale ranges in the level of a few fermi.

We find improved\nagreements with the data and obtain limits on the total branching ratio of the\naforementioned decay chain. The limits impose the strongest constraints on the\nparameter space of type-I two-Higgs-doublet model for most Higgs masses sampled\nwhen $H_i$ is the $CP$-odd Higgs boson $A$.

In\naddition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing,\nwhich produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the\neffective magnetic field (or \"axion wind\") produced by an axion-electron\ncoupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC\nmagnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC\nfields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC\nmagnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and\ndark-photon dark matter.

The\nstrength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors\n(TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that\nimplements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the\n$\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ decay widths,\n$\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the\n$\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\to 2(\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and\nasymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand\nsingularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for\nthe first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking\ncorrections. Our final results, $a_\\mu^{\\eta\\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\\times\n10^{-11}$ and $a_\\mu^{\\eta'\\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a\ndedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined\n$a_\\mu^{\\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\\times 10^{-11}$.",

The stronger laser field could not only\nimprove the scattering probability but also induce broader photon beam\ndivergence. To maximize the photon flux in a realistic narrow angular\nacceptance, we show that a balance must be met for the laser intensity to boost\nthe scattering probability and simultaneously confine its beam divergence. For\nthe currently experiment-concerned $10~\\textrm{GeV}$ energy regime, the\nbalanced laser intensity locates in the intermediate intensity regime of $\\xi\n\\sim O(1)$. In these regimes of laser intensity and electron energy, the\naccepted photons within a relatively narrow acceptance are highly polarized in\nthe state closely relating to the polarization of the laser pulse, which\nactually implies a potential route to finely control the photon polarization\nvia the laser polarization.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid development of high-power petawatt class lasers worldwide,\nexploring physics in the strong field QED regime will become one of the\nfrontiers for laser-plasma interactions research. Particle-in-cell codes,\nincluding quantum emission processes, are powerful tools for predicting and\nanalyzing future experiments where the physics of relativistic plasma is\nstrongly affected by strong-field QED processes. The spin/polarization\ndependence of these quantum processes has been of recent interest. In this\narticle, we perform a parametric study of the interaction of two laser pulses\nwith an ultrarelativistic electron beam. The first pulse is optimized to\ngenerate high-energy photons by nonlinear Compton scattering and efficiently\ndecelerate the electron beam through quantum radiation reaction. The second\npulse is optimized to generate electron-positron pairs by nonlinear\nBreit-Wheeler decay of the photons with the maximum polarization dependence.\nThis may be experimentally realized as a verification of the strong field QED\nframework, including the spin/polarization rates.",
