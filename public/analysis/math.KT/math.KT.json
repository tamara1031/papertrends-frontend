On the one hand, we show\nthat all the Milnor-Witt K-theory relations hold in the graded endomorphism\nring of the motivic sphere. On the other hand, we show that the positive\neigenspace $\\mathbf 1_\\mathbb Q^+$ of the rational motivic sphere is the\nrational motivic cohomology spectrum $\\mathrm H\\mathbb Q$, which represents the\neigenspaces of the Adams operations on rational algebraic K-theory. We deduce\nseveral familiar characterizations of $\\mathrm H\\mathbb Q$-modules in\n$\\mathrm{MS}$: a rational motivic spectrum is an $\\mathrm H\\mathbb Q$-module\niff it is orientable, iff the involution $\\langle -1\\rangle$ is the identity,\niff the Hopf map $\\eta$ is zero, iff it satisfies \\'etale descent. Moreover,\nthese conditions are automatic in many cases, for example over non-orderable\nfields and over $\\mathbb Z[\\zeta_n]$ for any $n\\geq 3$.",

The Gysin maps recently constructed by L. Tang are a\nkey ingredient in the proof. We then present several applications. First, we\nstudy $\\mathbb A^1$-colocalization, which transforms any module over the\n$\\mathbb A^1$-invariant sphere into an $\\mathbb A^1$-invariant motivic spectrum\nwithout changing its values on smooth projective schemes. This can be applied\nto all known $p$-adic cohomology theories and gives a new elementary approach\nto \"logarithmic\" or \"tame\" cohomology theories; it recovers for instance the\nlogarithmic crystalline cohomology of strict normal crossings compactifications\nover perfect fields and shows that the latter is independent of the choice of\ncompactification. Second, we prove a motivic Landweber exact functor theorem,\nassociating a motivic spectrum to any graded formal group law classified by a\nflat map to the moduli stack of formal groups. Using this theorem, we compute\nthe ring of $\\mathbb P^1$-stable cohomology operations on the algebraic\nK-theory of qcqs derived schemes, and we prove that rational motivic cohomology\nis an idempotent motivic spectrum.",

We prove that this $\\infty$-category satisfies $\\mathbb\nP^1$-homotopy invariance and weighted $\\mathbb A^1$-homotopy invariance, which\nwe use in place of $\\mathbb A^1$-homotopy invariance to obtain analogues of\nseveral key results from $\\mathbb A^1$-homotopy theory. These allow us in\nparticular to define a universal oriented motivic $\\mathbb E_\\infty$-ring\nspectrum $\\mathrm{MGL}$. We then prove that the algebraic K-theory of a qcqs\nderived scheme $X$ can be recovered from its $\\mathrm{MGL}$-cohomology via a\nConner-Floyd isomorphism \\[\\mathrm{MGL}^{**}(X)\\otimes_{\\mathrm L}\\mathbb\nZ[\\beta^{\\pm 1}]\\simeq \\mathrm K^{**}(X),\\] where $\\mathrm L$ is the Lazard\nring and $\\mathrm K^{p,q}(X)=\\mathrm K_{2q-p}(X)$. Finally, we prove a Snaith\ntheorem for the periodized version of $\\mathrm{MGL}$.",

In this paper we construct a\nmonoidal model structure on the category of pointed curved coalgebras ptdCoa*\nand show that the Quillen equivalence relating it to dgCat is monoidal. We also\nshow that dgCat is a ptdCoa*-enriched model category. As a consequence, the\nhomotopy category of dgCat is closed monoidal and is equivalent as a closed\nmonoidal category to the homotopy category of ptdCoa*. In particular, this\ngives a conceptual construction of a derived internal hom in dgCat. As an\napplication we obtain a new description of simplicial mapping spaces in dgCat\nand a calculation of their homotopy groups in terms of Hochschild cohomology\ngroups, reproducing and slightly generalizing well-known results of To\\\"en.\nComparing our approach to To\\\"en's, we also obtain a description of the core of\nLurie's dg nerve in terms of the ordinary nerve of a discrete category.",

In this situation, the categories of various internal categorical\nstructures in A, such as the categories of internal n-fold groupoids, are\nequivalent to functor categories [T,A] for a suitable category T. For a replete\nfull subcategory S of T, we define F to be the full subcategory of [T,A] whose\nobjects are given by the functors G with G(X)=0 for all objects X not in S. We\nprove that F is a torsion-free Birkhoff subcategory of [T,A].

In this paper we\nprovide new tools for the computation of the DY cohomology for finite tensor\ncategories and exact functors between them. The key point is to realize DY\ncohomology as relative Ext groups. In particular, we prove that the\ninfinitesimal deformations of a tensor category $\\mathcal{C}$ are classified by\nthe 3-rd self-extension group of the tensor unit of the Drinfeld center\n$\\mathcal{Z}(\\mathcal{C})$ relative to $\\mathcal{C}$. From classical results on\nrelative homological algebra we get a long exact sequence for DY cohomology and\na Yoneda product for which we provide an explicit formula. Using the long exact\nsequence and duality, we obtain a dimension formula for the cohomology groups\nbased solely on relatively projective covers which reduces a problem in\nhomological algebra to a problem in representation theory, e.g. calculating the\nspace of invariants in a certain object of $\\mathcal{Z}(\\mathcal{C})$. Thanks\nto the Yoneda product, we also develop a method for computing DY cocycles\nexplicitly which are needed for applications in the deformation theory.

We generalize this result to cases where\n$N$ may be noncompact, under assumptions on the way it is embedded into $M$.\nThis results in an equality between two classes in the $K$-theory of the Roe\nalgebra of $N$.

This leads us\nto define an $l^1$-version of higher rho invariants. We prove a product formula\nfor these $l^1$-higher rho invariants. A main novelty of our product formula is\nthat it works in the general Banach algebra setting, in particular, the\n$l^1$-setting.\n  On compact spin manifolds with boundary, we also give a sufficient geometric\ncondition for Dirac operators to have well-defined $l^1$-higher indices. More\nprecisely, we show that, on a compact spin manifold $M$ with boundary equipped\nwith a Riemannian metric which has product structure near the boundary, if the\nscalar curvature on the boundary is sufficiently large, then the $l^1$-higher\nindex of its Dirac operator $D_M$ is well-defined and lies in the $K$-theory of\nthe $l^1$-algebra of the fundamental group.
