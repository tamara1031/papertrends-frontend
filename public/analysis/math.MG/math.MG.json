We\nstudy generalizations of these concepts to Borel measures with density in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$-- in particular, the weighted versions of mixed volumes (the\nso-called mixed measures) when dealing with up to three distinct convex bodies.\nWe then formulate and analyze weighted versions of classical surface area\nmeasures, and obtain a new integral formula for the mixed measure of three\nbodies. As an application, we prove a B\\'ezout-type inequality for rotational\ninvariant log-concave measures, generalizing a result by Artstein-Avidan,\nFlorentin and Ostrover.

In\norder to obtain this inequality, sharp inclusion results between the convex\nbodies in this family are obtained whenever $g$ satisfies a better type of\nconcavity than the log-concavity, as $g_K$ is, indeed $\\frac{1}{n}$-concave.",

The set $A\\subset C$ is $C$-coconvex\nif the volume of $A$ is finite and $A^{\\bullet}=C\\setminus A$ is a closed\nconvex set. For $0<p<1$, the $p$-co-sum of $C$-coconvex sets is introduced, and\nthe corresponding $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski inequality for $C$-coconvex sets is\nestablished. We also define the $L_p$ surface area measures, for $0\\neq p\\in\n\\mathbb{R}$, of certain $C$-coconvex sets, which are critical in deriving a\nvariational formula of the volume of the Wulff shape associated with a family\nof functions obtained from the $p$-co-sum. This motivates the $L_p$ Minkowski\nproblem aiming to characterize the $L_p$ surface area measures of $C$-coconvex\nsets. The existence of solutions to the $L_p$ Minkowski problem for all $0\\neq\np\\in \\mathbb{R}$ is established. The $L_p$ Minkowski inequality for $0<p<1$ is\nproved and is used to obtain the uniqueness of the solutions to the $L_p$\nMinkowski problem for $0<p<1$.\n  For $p=0$, we introduce $(1-\\tau)\\diamond A_1\\oplus_0\\tau\\diamond A_2$, the\nlog-co-sum of two $C$-coconvex sets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ with respect to $\\tau\n\\in(0, 1)$, and prove the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality of $C$-coconvex sets.\nThe log-Minkowski inequality is also obtained and is applied to prove the\nuniqueness of the solutions to the log-Minkowski problem that characterizes the\ncone-volume measures of $C$-coconvex sets. Our result solves an open problem\nraised by Schneider in [Schneider, Adv. Math., 332 (2018), pp. 199-219].",

In the setting of non-smooth spaces with\nRicci curvature lower bounds (more precisely RCD(K,N) metric measure spaces):\n  - we develop an intrinsic theory of Laplacian bounds in viscosity sense and\nin a pointwise, heat flow related, sense, showing their equivalence also with\nLaplacian bounds in distributional sense;\n  - relying on these tools, we establish a PDE principle relating lower Ricci\ncurvature bounds to the preservation of Laplacian lower bounds under the\nevolution via the $p$-Hopf-Lax semigroup, for general exponents\n$p\\in[1,\\infty)$. This principle admits a broad range of applications, going\nmuch beyond the topic of the present paper;\n  - we prove sharp Laplacian bounds on the distance function from a set\n(locally) minimizing the perimeter with a flexible technique, not involving any\nregularity theory; this corresponds to vanishing mean curvature in the smooth\nsetting and encodes also information about the second variation of the area;\n  - we initiate a regularity theory for boundaries of sets (locally) minimizing\nthe perimeter, obtaining sharp dimension estimates for their singular sets,\nquantitative estimates of independent interest even in the smooth setting and\ntopological regularity away from the singular set.\n  The class of RCD(K,N) metric measure spaces includes as remarkable\nsub-classes: measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth manifolds with lower\nRicci curvature bounds and finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces with lower\nsectional curvature bounds. Most of the results are new also in these\nframeworks. Moreover, the tools that we develop here have applications to\nclassical questions in Geometric Analysis on smooth, non compact Riemannian\nmanifolds with lower Ricci curvature bounds.",
