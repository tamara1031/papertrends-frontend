We propose the modification of dijet invariant mass\ndistributions in heavy ion collisions as a novel observable that exhibits\nstriking sensitivity to the quark-gluon plasma transport properties and heavy\nquark mass effects on in-medium parton showers. This observable has the\nadvantage of amplifying the effects of jet quenching in contrast to\nconventional observables, such as the dijet momentum imbalance shift, which\ninvolve cancellations of such effects and, hence, result in less pronounced\nsignals. Predictions are presented for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n200 GeV to guide the future sPHENIX program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider.",

In this analysis,\nwe have used Tsallis statistics as an initial distribution and the Tsallis\nBlast wave (TBW) description is used as the equilibrium distribution function\nwhile describing the evolution of the particle production in BTE. We have\nfitted the transverse momentum spectra, $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ of identified\nhadrons such as pion, kaon, and proton for Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at the\nLHC energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV,\nrespectively for various centralities.

This\neffective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable\ninsights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from\nneutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from\nthe sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$\nwhich is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06\neV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted\nhierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to\nbe 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing\na potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values,\nwe calculate $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay. By combining $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear\nmatrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana\nneutrino, we estimate the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely,\n$^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods.
