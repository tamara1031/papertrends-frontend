          "abstract": "Conventional spoken language translation (SLT) systems are pipeline based\nsystems, where we have an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system to convert\nthe modality of source from speech to text and a Machine Translation (MT)\nsystems to translate source text to text in target language. Recent progress in\nthe sequence-sequence architectures have reduced the performance gap between\nthe pipeline based SLT systems (cascaded ASR-MT) and End-to-End approaches.\nThough End-to-End and cascaded ASR-MT systems are reaching to the comparable\nlevels of performances, we can see a large performance gap using the ASR\nhypothesis and oracle text w.r.t MT models. This performance gap indicates that\nthe MT systems are prone to large performance degradation due to noisy ASR\nhypothesis as opposed to oracle text transcript. In this work this degradation\nin the performance is reduced by creating an end to-end differentiable pipeline\nbetween the ASR and MT systems. In this work, we train SLT systems with ASR\nobjective as an auxiliary loss and both the networks are connected through the\nneural hidden representations. This train ing would have an End-to-End\ndifferentiable path w.r.t to the final objective function as well as utilize\nthe ASR objective for better performance of the SLT systems. This architecture\nhas improved from BLEU from 36.8 to 44.5. Due to the Multi-task training the\nmodel also generates the ASR hypothesis which are used by a pre-trained MT\nmodel. Combining the proposed systems with the MT model has increased the BLEU\nscore by 1. All the experiments are reported on English-Portuguese speech\ntranslation task using How2 corpus. The final BLEU score is on-par with the\nbest speech translation system on How2 dataset with no additional training data\nand language model and much less parameters.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-task encoder-decoder\npre-training framework (MMSpeech) for Mandarin automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), which employs both unlabeled speech and text data. The main difficulty\nin speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between\nspeech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike\nEnglish and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an\nideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to\none another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into\npre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between\nMandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning\nframework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and\ntext data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised\nspeech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing\nunlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and\nphoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To\ntrain the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce\nself-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme\nprediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we\ndirectly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the\npre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance\nand achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on\nAISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nwith a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training\nmethods.",

          "abstract": "Transfer learning from high-resource languages is known to be an efficient\nway to improve end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource\nlanguages. Pre-trained or jointly trained encoder-decoder models, however, do\nnot share the language modeling (decoder) for the same language, which is\nlikely to be inefficient for distant target languages. We introduce\nspeech-to-text translation (ST) as an auxiliary task to incorporate additional\nknowledge of the target language and enable transferring from that target\nlanguage. Specifically, we first translate high-resource ASR transcripts into a\ntarget low-resource language, with which a ST model is trained. Both ST and\ntarget ASR share the same attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and\nvocabulary. The former task then provides a fully pre-trained model for the\nlatter, bringing up to 24.6% word error rate (WER) reduction to the baseline\n(direct transfer from high-resource ASR). We show that training ST with human\ntranslations is not necessary. ST trained with machine translation (MT)\npseudo-labels brings consistent gains. It can even outperform those using human\nlabels when transferred to target ASR by leveraging only 500K MT examples. Even\nwith pseudo-labels from low-resource MT (200K examples), ST-enhanced transfer\nbrings up to 8.9% WER reduction to direct transfer.",

However,\nthe quality of AI-generated music has not yet reached this standard, primarily\ndue to the challenge of effectively controlling musical emotions and ensuring\nhigh-quality outputs. This paper presents a generalized symbolic music\ngeneration framework, XMusic, which supports flexible prompts (i.e., images,\nvideos, texts, tags, and humming) to generate emotionally controllable and\nhigh-quality symbolic music. XMusic consists of two core components, XProjector\nand XComposer. XProjector parses the prompts of various modalities into\nsymbolic music elements (i.e., emotions, genres, rhythms and notes) within the\nprojection space to generate matching music. XComposer contains a Generator and\na Selector. The Generator generates emotionally controllable and melodious\nmusic based on our innovative symbolic music representation, whereas the\nSelector identifies high-quality symbolic music by constructing a multi-task\nlearning scheme involving quality assessment, emotion recognition, and genre\nrecognition tasks. In addition, we build XMIDI, a large-scale symbolic music\ndataset that contains 108,023 MIDI files annotated with precise emotion and\ngenre labels.

To address\nthese issues, we first propose spatiotemporal features as powerful and\nfine-grained controls to enhance the controllability of the generative model.\nIn addition, an efficient music representation called REMI_Track is designed to\nconvert multitrack music into multiple parallel music sequences and shorten the\nsequence length of each track with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) techniques.\nSubsequently, we release BandControlNet, a conditional model based on parallel\nTransformers, to tackle the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality\nmusic samples that are conditioned to the given spatiotemporal control\nfeatures.

Humans tends to represent knowledge\nusing two separate systems: one for representing verbal (textual) information\nand one for representing non-verbal (visual and auditory) information. These\ntwo systems can operate independently but can also interact with each other.\nMotivated by this understanding of human cognition, in this paper, we introduce\nCoAVT -- a novel cognition-inspired Correlated Audio-Visual-Text pre-training\nmodel to connect the three modalities. It contains a joint audio-visual encoder\nthat learns to encode audio-visual synchronization information together with\nthe audio and visual content for non-verbal information, and a text encoder to\nhandle textual input for verbal information. To bridge the gap between\nmodalities, CoAVT employs a query encoder, which contains a set of learnable\nquery embeddings, and extracts the most informative audiovisual features of the\ncorresponding text. Additionally, to leverage the correspondences between audio\nand vision with language respectively, we also establish the audio-text and\nvisual-text bi-modal alignments upon the foundational audiovisual-text\ntri-modal alignment to enhance the multimodal representation learning. Finally,\nwe jointly optimize CoAVT model with three multimodal objectives: contrastive\nloss, matching loss and language modeling loss. Extensive experiments show that\nCoAVT can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various\ndownstream tasks.

          "abstract": "Audio signals generated by the human body (e.g., sighs, breathing, heart,\ndigestion, vibration sounds) have routinely been used by clinicians as\nindicators to diagnose disease or assess disease progression. Until recently,\nsuch signals were usually collected through manual auscultation at scheduled\nvisits. Research has now started to use digital technology to gather bodily\nsounds (e.g., from digital stethoscopes) for cardiovascular or respiratory\nexamination, which could then be used for automatic analysis. Some initial work\nshows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of COVID-19 from voice and\ncoughs. In this paper we describe our data analysis over a large-scale\ncrowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds collected to aid diagnosis of\nCOVID-19. We use coughs and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19\nsounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Our results show that even\na simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly\nhealthy and COVID-19 sounds. We also show how we distinguish a user who tested\npositive for COVID-19 and has a cough from a healthy user with a cough, and\nusers who tested positive for COVID-19 and have a cough from users with asthma\nand a cough. Our models achieve an AUC of above 80% across all tasks. These\nresults are preliminary and only scratch the surface of the potential of this\ntype of data and audio-based machine learning.

A scalable screening\ntool would be a game changer. Building on the prior work on cough-based\ndiagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-powered screening solution for COVID-19 infection that is\ndeployable via a smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends\nthree 3-second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the cloud, and returns a\nresult within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom of over thirty\nnon-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19\ninfection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We\naddress this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological\nalterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when\ncompared to other respiratory infections. To overcome the COVID-19 cough\ntraining data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis\nrisk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a\nmulti-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results\nshow AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among COVID-19 coughs and several types of\nnon-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage a\nlarge-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization\ncapability of AI4COVID-19. AI4COVID-19 is not a clinical grade testing tool.\nInstead, it offers a screening tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone. It\ncan also be a clinical decision assistance tool used to channel\nclinical-testing and treatment to those who need it the most, thereby saving\nmore lives.",

In\nparticular, the style encoder network is designed to learn style codes for\ndifferent subbands of the target speaker. The content encoder network can\ncapture the content information on the source speech. Finally, the decoder\ngenerates particular subband content.

We\ninvestigate how a recent voice conversion model performs on non-standard\ndownstream voice conversion tasks.

We look at four non-standard\napplications: stuttered voice conversion, cross-lingual voice conversion,\nmusical instrument conversion, and text-to-voice conversion. The latter\ninvolves converting to a target voice specified through a text description,\ne.g. \"a young man with a high-pitched voice\".

The self-supervised methods are not\nalways stable and perform differently, even for machines of the same type. In\naddition, the anomalous sound may be short-lived, making it even harder to\ndistinguish from normal sound. This paper proposes an ID constrained\nTransformer-based autoencoder (IDC-TransAE) architecture with weighted anomaly\nscore computation for unsupervised ASD. Machine ID is employed to constrain the\nlatent space of the Transformer-based autoencoder (TransAE) by introducing a\nsimple ID classifier to learn the difference in the distribution for the same\nmachine type and enhance the ability of the model in distinguishing anomalous\nsound. Moreover, weighted anomaly score computation is introduced to highlight\nthe anomaly scores of anomalous events that only appear for a short time.\nExperiments performed on DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 development dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

          "abstract": "Anomalous sound detection for machine condition monitoring has great\npotential in the development of Industry 4.0. However, these anomalous sounds\nof machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models\nemployed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for\ntraining, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we\npropose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect\nanomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic\nfeatures into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency\nmodeling. DPT blocks use attention modules to alternately model the interactive\ninformation about the frequency and temporal components of the segmented\nacoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt\na self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound.\nSpecifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic\nfeatures, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the\nperformance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the\nDCASE2021 task2 dataset. The experimental results show that the SSDPT network\nachieves a significant increase in the harmonic mean AUC score, in comparison\nto present state-of-the-art methods of anomalous sound detection.",

          "abstract": "While previous speech-driven talking face generation methods have made\nsignificant progress in improving the visual quality and lip-sync quality of\nthe synthesized videos, they pay less attention to lip motion jitters which\ngreatly undermine the realness of talking face videos. What causes motion\njitters, and how to mitigate the problem? In this paper, we conduct systematic\nanalyses on the motion jittering problem based on a state-of-the-art pipeline\nthat uses 3D face representations to bridge the input audio and output video,\nand improve the motion stability with a series of effective designs. We find\nthat several issues can lead to jitters in synthesized talking face video: 1)\njitters from the input 3D face representations; 2) training-inference mismatch;\n3) lack of dependency modeling among video frames. Accordingly, we propose\nthree effective solutions to address this issue: 1) we propose a gaussian-based\nadaptive smoothing module to smooth the 3D face representations to eliminate\njitters in the input; 2) we add augmented erosions on the input data of the\nneural renderer in training to simulate the distortion in inference to reduce\nmismatch; 3) we develop an audio-fused transformer generator to model\ndependency among video frames. Besides, considering there is no off-the-shelf\nmetric for measuring motion jitters in talking face video, we devise an\nobjective metric (Motion Stability Index, MSI), to quantitatively measure the\nmotion jitters by calculating the reciprocal of variance acceleration.\nExtensive experimental results show the superiority of our method on\nmotion-stable face video generation, with better quality than previous systems.",

          "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D face animation aims to generate realistic facial expressions\nthat match the speech content and emotion. However, existing methods often\nneglect emotional facial expressions or fail to disentangle them from speech\ncontent. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end neural\nnetwork to disentangle different emotions in speech so as to generate rich 3D\nfacial expressions. Specifically, we introduce the emotion disentangling\nencoder (EDE) to disentangle the emotion and content in the speech by\ncross-reconstructed speech signals with different emotion labels. Then an\nemotion-guided feature fusion decoder is employed to generate a 3D talking face\nwith enhanced emotion. The decoder is driven by the disentangled identity,\nemotional, and content embeddings so as to generate controllable personal and\nemotional styles. Finally, considering the scarcity of the 3D emotional talking\nface data, we resort to the supervision of facial blendshapes, which enables\nthe reconstruction of plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional data, and contribute\na large-scale 3D emotional talking face dataset (3D-ETF) to train the network.\nOur experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods and exhibits more diverse facial movements.

          "abstract": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.",

Of the very few current\nsystems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely\non an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of\nstems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly\nrequires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these\nsystems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. In this work, we\npropose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using\njust one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a\nquery-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On\nthe MoisesDB dataset, Banquet, at only 24.9 M trainable parameters, approached\nthe performance level of the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid\nTransformer Demucs on VDBO stems and outperformed it on guitar and piano. The\nquery-based setup allows for the separation of narrow instrument classes such\nas clean acoustic guitars, and can be successfully applied to the extraction of\nless common stems such as reeds and organs.

Each of these constituent components is often referred to as a \"stem\"\nin literature. Historically, music source separation has been dominated by a\nstem-based paradigm, leading to most state-of-the-art systems being either a\ncollection of single-stem extraction models, or a tightly coupled system with a\nfixed, difficult-to-modify, set of supported stems. Combined with the limited\ndata availability, advances in music source separation have thus been mostly\nlimited to the \"VDBO\" set of stems: \\textit{vocals}, \\textit{drum},\n\\textit{bass}, and the catch-all \\textit{others}. Recent work in music source\nseparation has begun to challenge the fixed-stem paradigm, moving towards\nmodels able to extract any musical sound as long as this target type of sound\ncould be specified to the model as an additional query input. We generalize\nthis idea to a \\textit{query-by-region} source separation system, specifying\nthe target based on the query regardless of how many sound sources or which\nsound classes are contained within it. To do so, we propose the use of\nhyperellipsoidal regions as queries to allow for an intuitive yet easily\nparametrizable approach to specifying both the target (location) as well as its\nspread. Evaluation of the proposed system on the MoisesDB dataset demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance of the proposed system both in terms of\nsignal-to-noise ratios and retrieval metrics.",

To\novercome this issue and support all the major separation tasks, we propose a\ntask-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model. The model uses a variable\nnumber of learnable prompts to specify which source to separate, and changes\nits behavior depending on the given prompts, enabling it to handle all the\nmajor separation tasks including contradictory ones. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed TUSS model successfully handles the five major\nseparation tasks mentioned earlier.
