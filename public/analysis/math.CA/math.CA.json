These situations\nappear in models of several physical processes, where small delay effects are\nadded. Even if the delays are small, they are very singular perturbations since\nthe natural phase space of an SDDE is an infinite dimensional space.\n  We show that the SDDE admits solutions which resemble the solutions of the\nODE. That is, there exist a periodic solution and a two parameter family of\nsolutions whose evolution converges to the periodic solution. Even if the phase\nspace of the SDDE is naturally a space of functions, we show that there are\ninitial values which lead to solutions similar to that of the ODE.\n  The method of proof bypasses the theory of existence, uniqueness, dependence\non parameters of SDDE. We consider the class of functions of time that have a\nwell defined behavior (e.g. periodic, or asymptotic to periodic) and derive a\nfunctional equation which imposes that they are solutions of the SDDE. These\nfunctional equations are studied using methods of functional analysis.

Thus, we can use the result to\nvalidate the results of numerical computations. The method of proof leads also\nto practical algorithms. In a companion paper, we present the implementation\ndetails and representative results.\n  One feature of the method presented here is that it allows to obtain smooth\ndependence on parameters for the periodic solutions and their slow stable\nmanifolds without studying the smoothness of the flow (which seems to be\nproblematic for SDDEs, for now the optimal result on smoothness of the flow is\n$C^1$).",

The primary objective of this paper\nis to establish the well-posedness and regularities for a class of fractional\ncalculus of variations problems and their Euler-Lagrange (fractional\ndifferential) equations. This is achieved first for one-sided Dirichlet energy\nfunctionals which lead to one-sided fractional Laplace equations, then for more\ngeneral energy functionals which give rise to more general fractional\ndifferential equations.",
