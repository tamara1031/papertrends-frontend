          "abstract": "The electromagnetic fields of a long dipole working without dispersive and\ndissipative losses are analyzed in the frequency domains. The dipole produces\nradiation in bursts of duration T/2 where T is the period of oscillation. The\nparameter studied in this paper is the energy, U, dissipated in a single burst\nof radiation of duration T/2. We have studied how U vary as a function of the\ncharge associated with the current in the dipole and the ratio of the length of\nthe dipole and its radius. We have observed a remarkable result when this ratio\nis equal to the ratio of the radius of the universe to the Bohr radius. Our\nresults, based purely on the classical electrodynamics and general relativity,\nshow that, as the magnitude of the oscillating charge (as defined by the root\nmean square) reduces to the electronic charge, the energy dissipated in a\nsingle burst of radiation reduces to hv, where v is the frequency of\noscillation and h is the Planck constant. The importance of this finding is\ndiscussed. In particular, the results show that the existence of a minimum free\ncharge in nature, i.e., electronic charge, is a direct consequence of the\nphotonic nature of the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the presented\nfindings allow to derive for the first time an expression for the vacuum energy\ndensity of the universe in terms of the other fundamental constants in nature,\nthe prediction of which is consistent with experimental observations. This\nequation, which combines the vacuum energy, electronic charge and mass, speed\nof light, gravitational constant and Planck constant, creates a link between\nclassical field theories (i.e., classical electrodynamics and general\nrelativity) and quantum mechanics.",

          "year": "2021-03",
          "abstract": "For electromagnetic field theories, canonical energy-momentum conservation\nlaws can be derived from the underpinning spacetime translation symmetry\naccording to the Noether procedure. However, the canonical Energy-Momentum\nTensors (EMTs) are neither symmetric nor gauge-symmetric (gauge invariant). The\nBelinfante-Rosenfeld (BR) method is a well-known procedure to symmetrize the\nEMTs, which also renders them gauge symmetric for first-order field theories.\nHigh-order electromagnetic field theories appear in the study of gyrokinetic\nsystems for magnetized plasmas and the Podolsky system for the radiation\nreaction of classical charged particles. For these high-order field theories,\ngauge-symmetric EMTs are not necessarily symmetric and vice versa. In the\npresent study, we develop a new gauge-symmetrization method for EMTs in\nhigh-order electromagnetic field theories. The Noether procedure is carried out\nusing the Faraday tensor F, instead of the 4-potential A, to derive a canonical\nEMT T_N. We show that the gauge-dependent part of T_N can be removed using the\ndisplacement-potential tensor \\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{D}*A/4\\pi, where \\mathcal{D}\nis the anti-symmetric electric displacement tensor. This method\ngauge-symmetrize the EMT without necessarily making it symmetric, which is\nadequate for applications not involving general relativity. For first-order\nelectromagnetic field theories, such as the standard Maxwell system,\n\\mathcal{F} reduces to the familiar BR super-potential \\mathcal{S}, and the\nmethod developed can be used as a simpler procedure to calculate \\mathcal{S}\nwithout employing the angular momentum tensor in 4D spacetime. When the\nelectromagnetic system is coupled to classical charged particles, the\ngauge-symmetrization method for EMTs is shown to be effective as well.",

          "year": "2021-10",
          "abstract": "In this paper is considered nonlinear electrodynamics (NE) which does not\nsatisfy the linear superposition principle (LSP). Since the presentation of the\nspecial theory of relativity, it has been commonly accepted that a famous\nformula E = mc^2 = m_0c^2 /(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) expresses the energy of a free\nparticle only. However, while studying the experiment for the annihilation of\nparticle and antiparticle and the production of the photon in terms of the law\nof energy conservation of particle and field, we obtain a conclusion that E\nincludes not only the energy of a free particle but also the energy of its self\n-fields (electromagnetic field and gravitational field). Hence, a formula for\nthe energy in the special theory of relativity comes to have a more inclusive\nmeaning than Einstein had thought of it. Based upon such an idea and the\ncorrespondence principle, through introducing a new non-Euclidean\nfour-dimensional space, so-called KR space in which the metric is the function\nof coordinates and 4-velocity, we reformulate the action function to be a\nfunction defined in the nonlinear version and from it find equation system for\na charge and the field with a modified version, which is reduced to that in the\nMaxwell theory under the weak field condition: here, weak field condition is\ngiven by |U/m_0c^2|<<1, U; interactional energy. With the equation system, we\nshow that the divergence problem arising from the Maxwell theory, without\ninvoking renormalization, is very naturally solved by sensible mathematics and\nthen demonstrate that the total energy of a free charge and its field equals\nmc^2 and so the energy of an electrostatic field leads to the finite. In this\ncourse are derived the modified version of Coulomb potential and of radiation\nreaction without renormalization which contains an interference effect (a\nnonlinear effect that does not obey LSP).",

For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by\nregarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many\ninconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to\nthese inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law\nwithout any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature\nof entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only\nwhen thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are\nTCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for\nsolids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On\nthis basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of\natoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be\nassigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by\ndiscrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations.\nAmong various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at\nsufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration,\nwhich do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that\nregion. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by\nexpressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes\nat $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended\nspace including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high\ntemperatures.
