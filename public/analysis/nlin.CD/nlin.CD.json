          "abstract": "Collecting time series data spatially distributed in many locations is often\nimportant for analyzing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. However,\ncomprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to\npredict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction\nof climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a\ntarget location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two\nprediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning\nframework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models\n(VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our\nresults show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance\nbetween the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the\ndistance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the\ncontext of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data\ncorrelation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the\nprediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting\nhighly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that\nmachine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic\nelements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data\nobservation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of\nclimate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.",

          "year": "2021-02",
          "abstract": "We consider the problem of data-assisted forecasting of chaotic dynamical\nsystems when the available data is in the form of noisy partial measurements of\nthe past and present state of the dynamical system. Recently there have been\nseveral promising data-driven approaches to forecasting of chaotic dynamical\nsystems using machine learning. Particularly promising among these are hybrid\napproaches that combine machine learning with a knowledge-based model, where a\nmachine-learning technique is used to correct the imperfections in the\nknowledge-based model. Such imperfections may be due to incomplete\nunderstanding and/or limited resolution of the physical processes in the\nunderlying dynamical system, e.g., the atmosphere or the ocean. Previously\nproposed data-driven forecasting approaches tend to require, for training,\nmeasurements of all the variables that are intended to be forecast. We describe\na way to relax this assumption by combining data assimilation with machine\nlearning. We demonstrate this technique using the Ensemble Transform Kalman\nFilter (ETKF) to assimilate synthetic data for the 3-variable Lorenz system and\nfor the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, simulating model error in each case by a\nmisspecified parameter value. We show that by using partial measurements of the\nstate of the dynamical system, we can train a machine learning model to improve\npredictions made by an imperfect knowledge-based model.",

We\naddress this challenge by developing a hybrid transformer and\nreservoir-computing machine-learning scheme.

The trained transformer is\nthen tested with the sparse data from the target system.

The emerging field of dissipative\nquantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems,\nwhere interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the\nfirst experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by\nmeasuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems\nimplemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing\ngradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for\nchaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum\nsystems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by\na sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of\nthe integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an\nintegrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the\nquantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process.

Often, the\npublished data exhibit very high uncertainties due to the observational\nlimitations that introduce chaos into the evolution of the system on especially\nshorter or longer timescales. We propose a study of the dynamics of such\nsystems by exploring particular regions in phase space. We exemplify our method\nby studying the long-term orbital stability of the three-planet system\nKepler-51 and either favor or constrain its data. It is a dual process which\nbreaks down in two steps: the computation of the families of periodic orbits in\nthe 1:2:3 resonant chain and the visualization of the phase space through maps\nof dynamical stability. We present novel results for the general four-body\nproblem. Stable periodic orbits were found only in the low-eccentricity regime.\nWe demonstrate three possible scenarios safeguarding Kepler-51, each followed\nby constraints. Firstly, there are the 2/1 and 3/2 two-body MMRs, in which\n$e_b<0.02$, such that these two-body MMRs last for extended time spans.\nSecondly, there is the 1:2:3 three-body Laplace-like resonance, in which\n$e_c<0.016$ and $e_d<0.006$ are necessary for such a chain to be viable.\nThirdly, there is the combination comprising the 1/1 secondary resonance inside\nthe 2/1 MMR for the inner pair of planets and an apsidal difference oscillation\nfor the outer pair of planets in which the observational eccentricities, $e_b$\nand $e_c$, are favored as long as $e_d\\approx 0$.

When subjected to tight rigid\nconstraints collisions might take place, leading to an additional infinitely\nstrong nonlinearity. The resulting dynamical regime involves both smooth\nnonlinear oscillations (SNOs) and a hybrid cubic vibro-impact (HCVI) regime.\nThe adaptive nonlinearity of the HCVI oscillator is used by the HCVI-nonlinear\nenergy sink (NES) as an effective mechanism for efficient vibration mitigation\nin broad energy and frequency ranges.

          "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to\ndescribe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent\nnonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations\nfollow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards\nstochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems\nwith constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with\nchaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory.\nThis study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth\nand death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show\nthat despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic\ndynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its\nstochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the\ndeterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where\nthe term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear\ndynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We\nobserve that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing\ndeterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the\ndynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience\nto demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations,\neven in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our\nunderstanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos\nand noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite\npopulations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.",

Of late,\nthere is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the\nenvironment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are\ninfluenced by the changing environment.

Memory, an ability that an agent changes his/her action\ndepending on the history of actions in previous games, is often introduced into\nlearning to explore more clever strategies and discuss the decision-making of\nreal agents like humans. However, such games with memory are hard to analyze\nbecause they exhibit complex phenomena like chaotic dynamics or divergence from\nNash equilibrium. In particular, how asymmetry in memory capacities between\nagents affects learning in games is still unclear. In response, this study\nformulates a gradient ascent algorithm in games with asymmetry memory\ncapacities. To obtain theoretical insights into learning dynamics, we first\nconsider a simple case of zero-sum games. We observe complex behavior, where\nlearning dynamics draw a heteroclinic connection from unstable fixed points to\nstable ones. Despite this complexity, we analyze learning dynamics and prove\nlocal convergence to these stable fixed points, i.e., the Nash equilibria. We\nidentify the mechanism driving this convergence: an agent with a longer memory\nlearns to exploit the other, which in turn endows the other's utility function\nwith strict concavity. We further numerically observe such convergence in\nvarious initial strategies, action numbers, and memory lengths.
