          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been much progress in the field of structural\nRamsey theory, in particular in the study of big Ramsey degrees. In all known\nexamples of infinite structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, there is in\nfact a single expansion of the structure, called a big Ramsey structure, which\ncorrectly encodes the exact big Ramsey degrees of every finite substructure\nsimultaneously. The first half of the article collects facts about this\nphenomenon that have appeared in the literature into a single cohesive\nframework, thus offering a conceptual survey of big Ramsey structures. We\npresent some original results indicating that the standard methods of proving\nfinite big Ramsey degrees automatically yield big Ramsey structures, often with\ndesirable extra properties. The second half of the article is a survey in the\nmore traditional sense, discussing numerous examples from the literature and\nshowing how they fit into our framework. We also present some general results\non how big Ramsey degrees are affected by expanding structures with unary\nfunctions.",

Despite significant progress in\nthe study of big Ramsey degrees, the big Ramsey degrees of many classes of\nstructures with finite small Ramsey degrees are still not well understood. We\nshow that if there are only finitely many relations of every arity greater than\none, then unrestricted relational structures have finite big Ramsey degrees,\nand give some evidence that this is tight. This is the first time finiteness of\nbig Ramsey degrees has been established for a random structure in an infinite\nlanguage. Our results represent an important step towards a better\nunderstanding of big Ramsey degrees for structures with relations of arity\ngreater than two.",

          "abstract": "We prove various results connected together by the common thread of\ncomputability theory. First, we investigate a new notion of algorithmic\ndimension, the inescapable dimension, which lies between the effective\nHausdorff and packing dimensions. We also study its generalizations, obtaining\nan embedding of the Turing degrees into notions of dimension. We then\ninvestigate a new notion of computability theoretic immunity that arose in the\ncourse of the previous study, that of a set of natural numbers with no\nco-enumerable subsets. We demonstrate how this notion of $\\Pi^0_1$-immunity is\nconnected to other immunity notions, and construct $\\Pi^0_1$-immune reals\nthroughout the high/low and Ershov hierarchies. We also study those degrees\nthat cannot compute or cannot co-enumerate a $\\Pi^0_1$-immune set. Finally, we\ndiscuss a recently discovered truth-table reduction for transforming a\nKolmogorov--Loveland random input into a Martin-L\\\"of random output by\nexploiting the fact that at least one half of such a KL-random is itself\nML-random. We show that there is no better algorithm relying on this fact,\ni.e., there is no positive, linear, or bounded truth-table reduction which does\nthis. We also generalize these results to the problem of outputting randomness\nfrom infinitely many inputs, only some of which are random.",

          "abstract": "Reimann and Slaman initiated the study of sequences that are Martin-L\\\"of\nrandom with respect to a continuous measure, establishing fundamental facts\nabout NCR, the collection of sequences that are not Martin-L\\\"of random with\nrespect to any continuous measure. In the case of sequences that are random\nwith respect to a computable, continuous measure, the picture is fairly\nwell-understood: such sequences are truth-table equivalent to a Martin-L\\\"of\nrandom sequence. However, given a sequence that is random with respect to a\ncontinuous measure but not with respect to any computable measure, we can ask:\nhow close to effective is the measure with respect to which it is continuously\nrandom?\n  In this study, we take up this question by examining various transformations\nof 2-random sequences (sequences that are Martin-L\\\"of random relative to the\nhalting set $\\emptyset'$) to establish several results on sequences that are\ncontinuously random with respect to a measure that is computable in\n$\\emptyset'$. In particular, we show that (i) every noncomputable sequence that\nis computable from a 2-random sequence is Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a\ncontinuous, $\\emptyset'$-computable measure and (ii) the Turing jump of every\n2-random sequence is Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a continuous,\n$\\emptyset'$-computable measure. From these results, we obtain examples of\nsequences that are not proper, i.e., not random with respect to any computable\nmeasure, but are random with respect to a continuous, $\\emptyset'$-computable\nmeasure. Lastly, we consider the behavior of 2-randomness under a wider class\nof effective operators (c.e. operators, pseudojump operators, and operators\ndefined in terms of pseudojump inversion), showing that these too yield\nsequences that are Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a continuous,\n$\\emptyset'$-computable measure.",
