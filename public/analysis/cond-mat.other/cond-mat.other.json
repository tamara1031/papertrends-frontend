          "abstract": "Cobalt based sulphides of compositional formula Co$ _{3} $A$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $\n(A = Sn and In) are endowed with frustrated kagome lattice structure and a\nplethora of novel phenomena determined from the topological band structure.\nHere-in, we report on the detailed exploration of anisotropic magnetic\nproperties of single crystals of ferromagnetic compound Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$\n_{2} $ under magnetic field $H$ applied along the c-axis $(H\\parallel c)$ and\nthe ab-plane $(H\\parallel ab)$. A low temperature clustered-glassy magnetic\nbehaviour is revealed in field-cooled and zero field-cooled magnetization and\nmemory effect measurement protocols. The sharp downturn and non-linearity\nobserved in the inverse susceptibility above the critical temperature $T\n_{\\text{C}} $ in the paramagnetic region corroborates to the presence of\nshort-range ferromagnetic clusters above $ T _{\\text{C}} $ in Co$ _{3} $Sn$\n_{2} $S$ _{2} $. The deviation from linear Curie-Weiss behaviour in the\nparamagnetic state signifies the strong Griffiths singularity in the material.\nThe slow spin dynamics behaviour and zero spontaneous magnetization above $ T\n_{\\text{C}} $ give an evidence of Griffiths phase owing to the ferromagnetic\nclusters. The Arrott plots derived from magnetization reveal convex type\ncurvature at low fields and linear positive behavior in the high field region,\nconfirming the second order magnetic phase transition in Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$\n_{2} $. The Takahashi spin fluctuation theory analysis provides sufficient\nevidence for itinerant ferromagnetism in Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $. A large\nmagneto-crystalline anisotropy concomitant with a high anisotropy field\nsuggests the dominance of strong spin orbit coupling phenomenon. Our\nexperimental results emphasize an intuitive understanding of the complex nature\nof magnetism present in Co-based shandite systems.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets represent one of the most\npromising horizons for energy-efficient spintronic applications because their\nbroad range of electronic, magnetic and topological properties. Of particular\ninterest is the control of the magnetic properties of 2D materials by\nfemtosecond laser pulses which can provide a real path for low-power\nconsumption device platforms in data storage industries. However, little is\nknown about the interplay between light and spin properties in vdW layers.\nHere, combining large-scale spin dynamics simulations including biquadratic\nexchange interactions and wide-field Kerr microscopy (WFKM), we show that\nultrafast laser excitation can not only generate different type of spin\ntextures in CrGeTe$_3$ vdW magnets but also induce a reversible transformation\nbetween them in a toggle-switch mechanism. Our calculations show that\nskyrmions, anti-skyrmions, skyrmioniums and stripe domains can be generated via\nhigh-intense laser pulses within the picosecond regime. The effect is tunable\nwith the laser energy where different spin behaviours can be selected, such as\nfast demagnetisation process ($\\sim$250 fs) important for information\ntechnologies. The phase transformation between the different topological spin\ntextures is obtained as additional laser pulses are applied to the system where\nthe polarisation and final state of the spins can be controlled by external\nmagnetic fields. We experimentally confirmed the creation, manipulation and\ntoggle switching phenomena in CrGeTe$_3$ due to the unique aspect of\nlaser-induced heating of electrons.

The model contains two exchange coupling\nparameters, which are calculated using Density Functional Theory, and a local\neasy axis magnetic anisotropy term. The classical ground state of the system is\na generalization of the well known 120$^\\circ$ structure observed in triangular\nantiferromagnets. Monte Carlo simulations show two phase transitions as a\nfunction of the temperature. With increasing temperature, the system\ntransitions from the ground state into a high-entropy collinear\nantiferromagnet, which in turn at higher temperatures presents a second order\ntransition to a paramagnetic state. A high enough external magnetic field\nparallel to the anisotropy axis produces a spin-flop transition at low\ntemperatures. The field also reduces the temperature range of stability of the\ncollinear antiferromagnet phase and leads to a single phase transition as a\nfunction of the temperature. The reported behavior of the specific heat, the\nmagnetization, and the magnetic susceptibility is in agreement with the\navailable experimental data. Finally, we present the magnetic phase diagrams\nfor magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the easy axis.",

However, the existence\nof a non-Hermitian skin effect for topological-protected edge states remains\ncontroversial. In this paper, we discover an alternative form of the\nnon-Hermitian skin effect called the non-Hermitian chiral skin effect (NHCSE).\nNHCSE is a non-Hermitian skin effect under periodic boundary condition rather\nthan open boundary condition. Specifically, the chiral modes of the NHCSE\nlocalize around \\textquotedblleft topological defects\\textquotedblright\ncharacterized by global dissipation rather than being confined to the system\nboundaries. We show its detailed physical properties by taking the\nnon-Hermitian Haldane model as an example. As a result, the intrinsic mechanism\nof the hybrid skin-topological effect in Chern insulators is fully understood\nvia NHCSE. Therefore, this progress will be helpful for solving the\ncontroversial topic of hybrid skin-topological effect and thus benefit the\nresearch on both non-Hermitian physics and topological quantum states.",

          "abstract": "For non-Hermitian quantum models, the dynamics is apparently not reflected by\nthe static properties, e.g., the complex energy spectrum, because of the\nnonorthogonality of the right eigenvectors, the nonunitarity of the time\nevolution, the breakdown of the adiabatic theory, etc., but in experiments the\ntime evolution of an initial state is commonly used. Here, we pay attention to\nthe dynamics of an initial end state in nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\nmodels under open boundary conditions, and we find that it is dynamically more\nrobust than its Hermitian counterpart, because the non-Hermitian skin effect\ncan suppress the part leaking to the bulk sites. To observe this, we propose a\nclassical electric circuit with only a few passive inductors and capacitors,\nthe mapping of which to the quantum model is established. This work explains\nhow the non-Hermitian skin effect enhances the robustness of the topological\nend state, and it offers an easy way, via the classical electric circuit, of\nstudying the nonreciprocal quantum dynamics, which may stimulate more dynamical\nstudies of non-Hermitian models in other platforms.",

          "abstract": "Like many quantum fluids, superfluid helium-4 (He II) can be considered as a\nmixture of two miscible fluid components: an inviscid superfluid and a viscous\nnormal fluid consisting of thermal quasiparticles [1]. A mutual friction\nbetween the two fluids can emerge due to quasiparticles scattering off\nquantized vortex lines in the superfluid [2]. This quantum dissipation\nmechanism is the key for understanding various fascinating behaviors of the\ntwo-fluid system [3,4]. However, due to the lack of experimental data for\nguidance, modeling the mutual friction between individual vortices and the\nnormal fluid remains an unsettled topic despite decades of research [5-10].\nHere we report an experiment where we visualize the motion of quantized vortex\nrings in He II by decorating them with solidified deuterium tracer particles.\nBy examining how the rings spontaneously shrink and accelerate, we provide\nunequivocal evidences showing that only a recent theory [9] which accounts for\nthe coupled motion of the two fluids with a self-consistent local friction can\nreproduce the observed ring dynamics. Our work eliminates long-standing\nambiguities in our theoretical description of the vortex dynamics in He II,\nwhich will have a far-reaching impact since similar mutual friction concept has\nbeen adopted for a wide variety of quantum two-fluid systems, including atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [11,12], superfluid neutron stars [13-15], and\ngravity-mapped holographic superfluid [16,17].",

          "abstract": "In quantum fluids, the quantisation of circulation forbids the diffusion of a\nvortex swirling flow seen in classical viscous fluids. Yet, a quantum vortex\naccelerating in a superfluid may lose its energy into acoustic radiation, in a\nsimilar way an electric charge decelerates upon emitting photons. The\ndissipation of vortex energy underlies central problems in quantum\nhydrodynamics, such as the decay of quantum turbulence, highly relevant to\nsystems as varied as neutron stars, superfluid helium and atomic condensates. A\ndeep understanding of the elementary mechanisms behind irreversible vortex\ndynamics has been a goal for decades, but it is complicated by the shortage of\nconclusive experimental signatures. Here, we address this challenge by\nrealising a programmable quantum vortex collider in a planar, homogeneous\natomic Fermi superfluid with tunable inter-particle interactions. We create\non-demand vortex configurations and monitor their evolution, taking advantage\nof the accessible time and length scales of our ultracold Fermi gas.\nEngineering collisions within and between vortex-antivortex pairs allows us to\ndecouple relaxation of the vortex energy due to sound emission and interactions\nwith normal fluid, i.e. mutual friction. We directly visualise how the\nannihilation of vortex dipoles radiates a sound pulse in the superfluid.\nFurther, our few-vortex experiments extending across different superfluid\nregimes suggest that fermionic quasiparticles localised inside the vortex core\ncontribute significantly to dissipation, opening the route to exploring new\npathways for quantum turbulence decay, vortex by vortex.",

They also reported that up to $10^4$ quantized vortices\naccumulated in the central region of the rotating flow. The quantized vortices\nin such macroscopic flows are assumed to form a bundle structure; however, the\nmechanism has not yet been fully investigated. Therefore, we prescribe a\nmacroscopic suction flow to the normal fluid and discuss the evolution of a\ngiant vortex ($\\textit{i.e.}$, one with a circulation quantum number exceeding\nunity) and a bundle of singly quantized vortices from a small number of seed\nvortices. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss several possible\ncharacteristic structures of the bundle in such a flow, and we suggest that the\nactual steady-state bundle structure in the experiment can be verified by\nmeasuring the diffusion constant of the vortex bundle after the macroscopic\nnormal flow has been switched off.
