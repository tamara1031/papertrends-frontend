          "year": "2020-04",
          "abstract": "Research software has become a central asset in academic research. It\noptimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds\nresearch knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself.\nResearch software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate,\nreproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research\neffectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable,\nand adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software\ntherefore requires an environment that supports sustainability. Hence, a change\nis needed in the way research software development and maintenance are\ncurrently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally\nsupported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and\nvalidity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research\nsoftware sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation,\nselection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure,\nand legal aspects. Besides researchers, we specifically address political and\nacademic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of\nsustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies\nand measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with\nthe ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid,\nreproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a first class\ncitizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany\nin 2019, at deRSE19 - the first International Conference of Research Software\nEngineers in Germany - and a dedicated DFG-supported follow-up workshop in\nBerlin.",

          "abstract": "The Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice (ADJRP) project aims to\nwiden the lens of current thinking around data justice and to provide\nactionable resources that will help policymakers, practitioners, and impacted\ncommunities gain a broader understanding of what equitable, freedom-promoting,\nand rights-sustaining data collection, governance, and use should look like in\nincreasingly dynamic and global data innovation ecosystems. In this integrated\nliterature review we hope to lay the conceptual groundwork needed to support\nthis aspiration. The introduction motivates the broadening of data justice that\nis undertaken by the literature review which follows. First, we address how\ncertain limitations of the current study of data justice drive the need for a\nre-location of data justice research and practice. We map out the strengths and\nshortcomings of the contemporary state of the art and then elaborate on the\nchallenges faced by our own effort to broaden the data justice perspective in\nthe decolonial context. The body of the literature review covers seven thematic\nareas. For each theme, the ADJRP team has systematically collected and analysed\nkey texts in order to tell the critical empirical story of how existing social\nstructures and power dynamics present challenges to data justice and related\njustice fields. In each case, this critical empirical story is also\nsupplemented by the transformational story of how activists, policymakers, and\nacademics are challenging longstanding structures of inequity to advance social\njustice in data innovation ecosystems and adjacent areas of technological\npractice.",

          "abstract": "Consensus on the definition of data science remains low despite the\nwidespread establishment of academic programs in the field and continued demand\nfor data scientists in industry. Definitions range from rebranded statistics to\ndata-driven science to the science of data to simply the application of machine\nlearning to so-called big data to solve real-world problems. Current efforts to\ntrace the history of the field in order to clarify its definition, such as\nDonoho's \"50 Years of Data Science\" (Donoho 2017), tend to focus on a short\nperiod when a small group of statisticians adopted the term in an unsuccessful\nattempt to rebrand their field in the face of the overshadowing effects of\ncomputational statistics and data mining. Using textual evidence from primary\nsources, this essay traces the history of the term to the 1960s, when it was\nfirst used by the US Air Force in a surprisingly similar way to its current\nusage, to 2012, the year that Harvard Business Review published the enormously\ninfluential article \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\"\n(Davenport and Patil 2012) and the American Statistical Association\nacknowledged a profound disconnect between statistics and data science\n(Rodriguez 2012). Among the themes that emerge from this review are (1) the\nlong-standing opposition between data analysts and data miners that continues\nto animate the field, (2) an established definition of the term as the practice\nof managing and processing scientific data that has been occluded by recent\nusage, and (3) the phenomenon of data impedance -- the disproportion between\nsurplus data, indexed by phrases like data deluge and big data, and the\nlimitations of computational machinery and methods to process them. This\npersistent condition appears to have motivated the use of the term and the\nfield itself since its beginnings.",

Our qualitative research includes a literature review that highlights the\ncross-referencing of these angles by discussing the value and drawbacks of\ncontrastive top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches previously published.\nThe novel contribution to this framework is the political angle, which\nconstitutes ethics in AI either being determined by corporations and\ngovernments and imposed through policies or law (coming from the top), or\nethics being called for by the people (coming from the bottom), as well as\ntop-down, bottom-up, and hybrid technicalities of how AI is developed within a\nmoral construct and in consideration of its users, with expected and unexpected\nconsequences and long-term impact in the world. There is a focus on\nreinforcement learning as an example of a bottom-up applied technical approach\nand AI ethics principles as a practical top-down approach. This investigation\nincludes real-world case studies to impart a global perspective, as well as\nphilosophical debate on the ethics of AI and theoretical future thought\nexperimentation based on historical facts, current world circumstances, and\npossible ensuing realities.",

          "abstract": "This research provides an in-depth comprehensive review of the progress of\nchatbot technology over time, from the initial basic systems relying on rules\nto today's advanced conversational bots powered by artificial intelligence.\nSpanning many decades, the paper explores the major milestones, innovations,\nand paradigm shifts that have driven the evolution of chatbots. Looking back at\nthe very basic statistical model in 1906 via the early chatbots, such as ELIZA\nand ALICE in the 1960s and 1970s, the study traces key innovations leading to\ntoday's advanced conversational agents, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. The\nstudy synthesizes insights from academic literature and industry sources to\nhighlight crucial milestones, including the introduction of Turing tests,\ninfluential projects such as CALO, and recent transformer-based models. Tracing\nthe path forward, the paper highlights how natural language processing and\nmachine learning have been integrated into modern chatbots for more\nsophisticated capabilities. This chronological survey of the chatbot landscape\nprovides a holistic reference to understand the technological and historical\nfactors propelling conversational AI. By synthesizing learnings from this\nhistorical analysis, the research offers important context about the\ndevelopmental trajectory of chatbots and their immense future potential across\nvarious field of application which could be the potential take ways for the\nrespective research community and stakeholders.",

          "year": "2022-04",
          "abstract": "Interactive machine learning (IML) is a field of research that explores how\nto leverage both human and computational abilities in decision making systems.\nIML represents a collaboration between multiple complementary human and machine\nintelligent systems working as a team, each with their own unique abilities and\nlimitations. This teamwork might mean that both systems take actions at the\nsame time, or in sequence. Two major open research questions in the field of\nIML are: \"How should we design systems that can learn to make better decisions\nover time with human interaction?\" and \"How should we evaluate the design and\ndeployment of such systems?\" A lack of appropriate consideration for the humans\ninvolved can lead to problematic system behaviour, and issues of fairness,\naccountability, and transparency. Thus, our goal with this work is to present a\nhuman-centred guide to designing and evaluating IML systems while mitigating\nrisks. This guide is intended to be used by machine learning practitioners who\nare responsible for the health, safety, and well-being of interacting humans.\nAn obligation of responsibility for public interaction means acting with\nintegrity, honesty, fairness, and abiding by applicable legal statutes. With\nthese values and principles in mind, we as a machine learning research\ncommunity can better achieve goals of augmenting human skills and abilities.\nThis practical guide therefore aims to support many of the responsible\ndecisions necessary throughout the iterative design, development, and\ndissemination of IML systems.",

          "abstract": "If Turing's groundbreaking paper in 1936 laid the foundation of the theory of\ncomputation (ToC), it is no exaggeration to say that Cook's paper in 1971, \"The\ncomplexity of theorem proving procedures\", [4] has pioneered the study of\ncomputational complexity. So computational complexity, as an independent\nresearch field, is 50 years old now (2021) if we date from Cook's article. This\nyear coincides with the 100th birthday of Cook's mentor Hao Wang, one of the\nmost important logicians. This paper traces the origin of computational\ncomplexity, and meanwhile, tries to sort out the instrumental role that Wang\nplayed in the process.",

          "abstract": "In the late 80s and 90s, theoretical physicists of the Landau Institute for\nTheoretical Physics designed and developed several specialized computers for\nchallenging computational problems in the physics of phase transitions. These\ncomputers did not have a central processing unit. They optimize algorithms to\nhandle elementary operations on integers -- read, write, compare, and count.\nThe approach allowed them to achieve recording run times. Computers performed\ncalculations three orders of magnitude faster than similar calculations on the\nworld's best supercomputers. The approach made it possible to obtain\nfundamentally new results, some of which have not yet been surpassed in the\naccuracy of calculations. The report will present the main ideas for the\ndevelopment of specialized computers and the scientific results obtained with\ntheir help. The lessons of planning and execution of long-term complex\nscientific projects will also be discussed.",

          "abstract": "In this survey, we explore Andrei Nikolayevich Kolmogorov's seminal work in\njust one of his many facets: its influence Computer Science especially his\nviewpoint of what herein we call 'Algorithmic Theory of Informatics.'\n  Can a computer file 'reduce' its 'size' if we add to it new symbols? Do\nequations of state like second Newton law in Physics exist in Computer Science?\nCan Leibniz' principle of identification by indistinguishability be formalized?\n  In the computer, there are no coordinates, no distances, and no dimensions;\nmost of traditional mathematical approaches do not work. The computer processes\nfinite binary sequences i.e. the sequences of 0 and 1. A natural question\narises: Should we continue today, as we have done for many years, to approach\nComputer Science problems by using classical mathematical apparatus such as\n'mathematical modeling'? The first who drew attention to this question and gave\ninsightful answers to it was Kolmogorov in 1960s. Kolmogorov's empirical\npostulate about existence of a program that translates 'a natural number into\nits binary record and the record into the number' formulated in 1958 represents\na hint of Kolmogorov's approach to Computer Science.\n  Following his ideas, we interpret Kolmogorov algorithm, Kolmogorov machine,\nand Kolmogorov complexity in the context of modern information technologies\nshowing that they essentially represent fundamental elements of Algorithmic\nTheory of Informatics, Kolmogorov Programmable Technology, and new Komputer\nMathematics i.e. Mathematics of computers.",
