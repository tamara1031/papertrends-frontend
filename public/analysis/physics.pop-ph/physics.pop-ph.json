          "abstract": "The water bottle flip experiment is a recreational, non-conventional\nillustration of the conservation of angular moment. When a bottle partially\nfilled with water is thrown in a rotational motion, water redistributes\nthroughout the bottle, resulting in an increase of moment of inertia and thus\nto a decrease in angular velocity, which increases the probability of it\nfalling upright on a table as compared with a bottle filled with ice. The\ninvestigation of this phenomenom is accessible to undergraduate students and\nshould allow them to gain better understanding of combined translational and\nrotational motions in classical mechanics. In addition to reporting a series of\ndetailed experiments and analyzing them using standard image analysis, we\nprovide a simple theoretical framework and subsequent numerical implementation\nbased on the decomposition of the water volume into thin slices of a rigid body\nthat are subjected to fictitious forces in the non-inertial frame of the\nspinning bottle. This model allows us to capture quantitatively the main\nexperimental findings, including the angular velocity slow-down for a given\nrange of water filling fractions. Finally, we discuss additionnal\ncounter-intuitive effects that contribute to bottle stabilization on landing.",

          "abstract": "The knuckleball is perhaps the most enigmatic pitch in baseball. Relying on\nthe presence of raised seams on the surface of the ball to create asymmetric\nflow, a knuckleball's trajectory has proven very challenging to predict\ncompared to other baseball pitches, such as fastballs or curveballs. Previous\nexperimental tracking of large numbers of knuckleballs has shown that they can\nmove in essentially any direction relative to what would be expected from a\ndrag-only trajectory. This has led to speculation that knuckleballs exhibit\nchaotic motion. Here we develop a relatively simple model of a knuckleball that\nincludes quadratic drag and lift from asymmetric flow which is taken from\nexperimental measurements of slowly rotating baseballs. Our models can indeed\nexhibit dynamical chaos as long In contrast, models that omit torques on the\nball in flight do not show chaotic behavior. Uncertainties in the phase space\nposition of the knuckleball are shown to grow by factors as large as $10^6$\nover the flight of the ball from the pitcher to home plate. We quantify the\nimpact of our model parameters on the chaos realized in our models,\nspecifically showing that maximum Lyapunov exponent is roughly proportional to\nthe square root of the effective lever arm of the torque, and also roughly\nproportional to the initial velocity of the pitch. We demonstrate the existence\nof bifurcations that can produce changes in the location of the ball when it\nreaches the plate of as much as 1.2 m for specific initial conditions similar\nto those used by professional knuckleball pitchers. As we introduce additional\ncomplexity in the form of more faithful representations of the empirical\nasymmetry force measurements, we find that a larger fraction of the possible\ninitial conditions result in dynamical chaos.",

          "abstract": "In arXiv:2107.05714 the concept of the Voronoi diagram was investigated\nclosely from a theoretical point of view. Then, a physics-driven kinematical\nmethod was introduced to produce an improved model for dominance space in\nsoccer. Remaining faithful to the deterministic approach, we extend the\noriginal work by the introduction of (a) an asymmetric influence of the players\nin their surrounding area, (b) the frictional forces to the players' motion,\nand (c) the simultaneous combination of both effects. The asymmetric influence\nis fairly intuitive; players have more control in the direction they are\nrunning than any other direction. The sharper the turn they must make to reach\na point on the pitch, the weaker their control of that point will be. From\nsimple kinematical laws, this effect can be quantified explicitly. For the\nfrictional force, a portion comes from air resistance, and so will be\nproportional to the square of the player's speed, as is well known from fluid\ndynamics. There are no other external frictional forces, but, at the suggestion\nof biokinematics, there is an internal frictional force, relating to the\nconsumption of energy by the muscles, which is proportional to the player's\nspeed.\n  Although these additions are intuitively understood, mathematically they\nintroduce many analytical complexities. We establish exact analytical solutions\nof the dominance areas of the pitch by introducing a few reasonable simplifying\nassumptions. Given these solutions the new Voronoi diagrams are drawn for the\npublicly available data by Metrica Sports. In general, it is not necessary\nanymore for the dominance regions to be convex, they might contain holes, and\nmay be disconnected. The fastest player may dominate points far away from the\nrest of the players.",

The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of\ncurrent and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at\nultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on\nthe detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface\nmodifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and\ninterstellar flight.

Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected,\nshould set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have\nbeen able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their\ntarget sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio\ntransmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have\ndeveloped. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the\naxis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods\ncommensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of\ndetectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio\ntransmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures,\nand objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth\ninstruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of\nthe growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's\nspace-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with\nintermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar)\nbeating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection\ndistance.

          "abstract": "In the modern search for life elsewhere in the Universe, we are broadly\nlooking for the following: the planets similar to Earth - physical indicators\nof habitability, and the manifestation of life - the biological signatures. A\nbiosignature is a measured parameter that has a high probability of being\ncaused by the living organisms, either atmospheric gas species or some surface\nfeatures. Therefore, the focus of a search is on a product or phenomena\nproduced by the living systems, mostly by microorganisms as these are the most\nabundant on our planet like, say, methane. However, we may need to distinguish\nthe terms `biosignature' and `bioindicator'. A biosignature is what living\norganisms produce - a bioproduct, while a bioindicator may be anything\nnecessary for life as we know it, such as water or a rocky planet. Oxygen in\nthis case is a double biomarker; first, it is a byproduct of oxygenic\nphotosynthesis and, second, it is a signature of a complex life, because\ncomplex highly organized life requires high levels of oxygen. It is possible\nthat there are other such bioindicators. For example, in the atmospheric\ncompositions of terrestrial planets in our Solar System (including Titan),\nargon is one of the major constituents, moreover it was recently acknowledged\nto be a `biologically' active gas, exhibiting organprotective and\nneuroprotective properties, especially under hypoxic conditions. Here we\npropose that argon in the atmosphere of a rocky planet is a bioindicator of a\nhighly organized life, provided that the planet is already deemed potentially\nhabitable: with water, atmosphere, and of a certain age allowing for the\ncomplex life to evolve.

Consequently,\nextrapolating from terrestrial life to life elsewhere in the galaxy and beyond\nis often seen as a limitation in the search for different forms of life.\nEssentially, attempting to extrapolate from terrestrial life to life elsewhere\nimplies that terrestrial life is representative of all life, reflecting a\ngeocentric viewpoint. However, in accordance with the Copernican principle, the\nopposite holds true. Asserting that terrestrial life must differ from other\nforms of life in the universe is, in fact, the geocentric viewpoint. For if\nlife elsewhere is not like terrestrial life, then it is ipso facto different\nlife; more precisely, if terrestrial life does not represent general life, then\nthat life must represent special life, which the principle states it is not.\nThis study employs the Copernican principle as a probability assessment,\naddressing critiques rooted in the implicit assumption of the existence of\ndifferent extraterrestrial forms of life. If various fundamental forms of life\nindeed exist, then differences in the probabilities of their emergence can be\nexpected, forming a probability scale. This holds significance because it not\nonly allows for insights into the characteristics of the majority of life\nelsewhere but also facilitates the establishment of boundaries for categories\nof life as we do not know it.

The focus of most topics will be split upon three general points in the\npopulation: one thousand, hundreds of thousands, and millions. Important\ndecisions involving government and society will be discussed, as well as the\nneed for an aesthetically pleasing colony. Additionally, our given scenario\nassumes that prior missions lacking human presence on the planet will take\nplace, which will allow for the set-up of nuclear generators by way of robot\nand the continued robotic research that has taken place for decades. An\nin-depth discussion of the distribution of this source as well as any other\nform of power will still be necessary. We also can assume that irrigation water\nand fertilizers have been found on Mars. Furthermore, the expected costs of\nshipping goods from Earth to Mars and then from Mars to Earth will be 500 and\n200 dollars per kg, respectively.",

          "abstract": "If humanity is ever to consider substantial, long-term colonization of Mars,\nthe resources needed are going to be extensive. For a long-term human presence\non Mars to be established, serious thought would need to be given to\nterraforming the planet. One major requirement for such terraforming is having\nthe protection of a planetary magnetic field which Mars currently does not\nhave. In this article we explore comprehensively for the first time, the\npractical and engineering challenges that affect the feasibility of creating an\nartificial magnetic field capable of encompassing Mars. This includes the\nconcerns that define the design, where to locate the magnetic field generator\nand possible construction strategies. The rationale here is not to justify the\nneed for a planetary magnetosphere but to put figures on the practicalities so\nas to be able to weigh the pros and cons of the different engineering\napproaches.\n  The optimum solution proposed is completely novel, although inspired by\nnatural situations and fusion plasma techniques. The solution with the lowest\npower, assembly and mass is to create an artificial charged particle ring\n(similar in form to a \"radiation belt\"), around the planet possibly formed by\nejecting matter from one of the moons of Mars (in fashion similar to that that\nforms the Io-Jupiter plasma torus), but using electromagnetic and plasma waves\nto drive a net current in the ring(s) that results in an overall magnetic\nfield.\n  With a new era of space exploration underway, this is the time to start\nthinking about these new and bold future concepts and to begin filling\nstrategic knowledge gaps. Furthermore, the principles explored here are also\napplicable to smaller scale objects like manned spacecraft, space stations or\nmoon bases, which would benefit from the creation of protective\nmini-magnetospheres.",

          "title": "Combined Airborne Wind and Photovoltaic Energy System for Martian Habitats",
          "year": "2021-04",
          "abstract": "Generating renewable energy on Mars is technologically challenging. Firstly,\nbecause compared to Earth, key energy resources such as solar and wind are weak\nas a result of very low atmospheric pressure and low solar irradiation.\nSecondly, because of the harsh environmental conditions, the required high\ndegree of automation and the exceptional effort and costs to transport material\nto the planet. Like on Earth, it is crucial to combine complementary resources\nfor an effective renewable energy solution. In this work, we present the result\nof a design synthesis exercise, a 10 kW microgrid solution, based on a pumping\nkite power system and photovoltaic solar modules to power the construction as\nwell as the subsequent use of a Mars habitat. To buffer unavoidable energy\nfluctuations and balance seasonal and diurnal resource variations, the two\nenergy systems are combined with a compressed gas storage system and\nlithium-sulfur batteries. The airborne wind energy solution was selected\nbecause of its low weight-to-wing-surface-area ratio, compact packing volume\nand high capacity factor which enables it to endure strong dust storms in an\nairborne parking mode. The surface area of the membrane wing is 50 m2 and the\nmass of the entire system, including the kite control unit and ground station,\nis 290 kg. The performance of the microgrid is assessed by computational\nsimulation using available resource data for a chosen deployment location on\nMars. The projected costs of the system are 8.95 million Euro, excluding\ntransportation to Mars.",
