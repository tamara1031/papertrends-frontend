          "abstract": "Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions\ncharacterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its\ntime-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this\nphenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include\nenvironmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects.\nHowever, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes\nand interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under\nfull open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by\nincorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that\nDQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle\nloss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both\nprocesses coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we\nuncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain\n(loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time\nbehavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These\nphenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large\ndynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from\nnon-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are\ngeneral and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical\nsimulations.",

          "abstract": "Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum\nmany-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial\nconditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist\nfor any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form\nof an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state\neigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars,\ndiscovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the\nexperimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated\nhelix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ\nchains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are\nwell-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \\to \\infty$, which allows for a\nsystematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to\nperturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we\npredict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space,\nGranovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay:\ndepending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is\neither slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be\ntraced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the\nBogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which\ncorresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the\nlimiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product\nstates (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that\nour prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our\nfindings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.",

          "abstract": "Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum\nmany-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special\nnon-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require\nfine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that\nlong-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We\nanalyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\\alpha$\nof spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit\n$\\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of\nchaos appear for infinitesimal $\\alpha$, the towers of $\\alpha=0$ energy\neigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\\alpha$ is\nincreased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature\nand fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach\nbased on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor\nnon-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally\nsolve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a\nnovel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent\nlocalization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0<\\alpha<d$\n(with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability\nmechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its\nbreakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical\nchaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a\nbyproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating\nunder periodic driving for $0<\\alpha<d$, beyond existing\nFloquet-prethermalization theorems.",

          "abstract": "Non-Hermitian generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with\nhigher periods of the hopping coefficients, called the SSH3 and SSH4 models,\nare analyzed. The conventional construction of the winding number fails for the\nHermitian SSH3 model, but the non-Hermitian generalization leads to a\ntopological system due to a point gap on the complex plane. The non-Hermitian\nSSH3 model thus has a winding number and exhibits the non-Hermitian skin\neffect. Moreover, the SSH3 model has two types of localized states and a\nzero-energy state associated with special symmetries. The total Zak phase of\nthe SSH3 model exhibits quantization, and its finite value indicates\ncoexistence of the two types of localized states. Meanwhile, the SSH4 model\nresembles the SSH model, and its non-Hermitian generalization also exhibits the\nnon-Hermitian skin effect.

Fundamentally, this limit\narises from the non-commuting nature of quantum mechanics, leading to the\npresence of fluctuations often referred to as quantum projection noise. Quantum\nmetrology relies on the use of non-classical states of many-body systems in\norder to enhance the precision of measurements beyond the standard quantum\nlimit. To do so, one can reshape the quantum projection noise -- a strategy\nknown as squeezing. In the context of many-body spin systems, one typically\nutilizes all-to-all interactions (e.g. the one-axis twisting model) between the\nconstituents to generate the structured entanglement characteristic of spin\nsqueezing. Motivated by recent theoretical work, here we explore the prediction\nthat short-range interactions -- and in particular, the two-dimensional dipolar\nXY model -- can also enable the realization of scalable spin squeezing. Working\nwith a dipolar Rydberg quantum simulator of up to 100 atoms, we demonstrate\nthat quench dynamics from a polarized initial state lead to spin squeezing that\nimproves with increasing system size up to a maximum of -3.5 dB (prior to\ncorrecting for detection errors, or approximately -5 dB after correction).\nFinally, we present two independent refinements: first, using a multistep\nspin-squeezing protocol allows us to further enhance the squeezing by\napproximately 1 dB, and second, leveraging Floquet engineering to realize\nHeisenberg interactions, we demonstrate the ability to extend the lifetime of\nthe squeezed state by freezing its dynamics.",

A\ndeep understanding of the elementary mechanisms behind irreversible vortex\ndynamics has been a goal for decades, but it is complicated by the shortage of\nconclusive experimental signatures. Here, we address this challenge by\nrealising a programmable quantum vortex collider in a planar, homogeneous\natomic Fermi superfluid with tunable inter-particle interactions. We create\non-demand vortex configurations and monitor their evolution, taking advantage\nof the accessible time and length scales of our ultracold Fermi gas.\nEngineering collisions within and between vortex-antivortex pairs allows us to\ndecouple relaxation of the vortex energy due to sound emission and interactions\nwith normal fluid, i.e. mutual friction. We directly visualise how the\nannihilation of vortex dipoles radiates a sound pulse in the superfluid.\nFurther, our few-vortex experiments extending across different superfluid\nregimes suggest that fermionic quasiparticles localised inside the vortex core\ncontribute significantly to dissipation, opening the route to exploring new\npathways for quantum turbulence decay, vortex by vortex.",
