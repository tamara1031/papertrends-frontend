This\nworks well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity\nproofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a\nlong-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\n\"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying\ndifficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type\ntheory in the absence of UIP.\n  In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families\n($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the\npreviously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity\nsubstitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The\ntype-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although\nit remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known\nunsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is\npresented in two-level type theory (2LTT).\n  Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, the paper explains the shortcomings of\n1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and\napproaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

The field of eXplainable AI (XAI)\nstrives to address this major concern, being critical in high-stakes areas such\nas the finance, legal and health sectors.\n  We present an approach to defining AI models and their interpretability based\non category theory. For this we employ the notion of a compositional model,\nwhich sees a model in terms of formal string diagrams which capture its\nabstract structure together with its concrete implementation. This\ncomprehensive view incorporates deterministic, probabilistic and quantum\nmodels. We compare a wide range of AI models as compositional models, including\nlinear and rule-based models, (recurrent) neural networks, transformers, VAEs,\nand causal and DisCoCirc models.\n  Next we give a definition of interpretation of a model in terms of its\ncompositional structure, demonstrating how to analyse the interpretability of a\nmodel, and using this to clarify common themes in XAI. We find that what makes\nthe standard 'intrinsically interpretable' models so transparent is brought out\nmost clearly diagrammatically. This leads us to the more general notion of\ncompositionally-interpretable (CI) models, which additionally include, for\ninstance, causal, conceptual space, and DisCoCirc models.\n  We next demonstrate the explainability benefits of CI models. Firstly, their\ncompositional structure may allow the computation of other quantities of\ninterest, and may facilitate inference from the model to the modelled\nphenomenon by matching its structure. Secondly, they allow for diagrammatic\nexplanations for their behaviour, based on influence constraints, diagram\nsurgery and rewrite explanations.

We also discuss fusions of topological defects, which involve\ncondensations/gaugings of higher-categorical symmetries localized on the\nworldvolumes of topological defects. Recently some fusions of topological\ndefects were discussed in the literature where the dimension of topological\ndefects seems to jump under fusion. This is not possible in the standard\ndescription of higher-categories. We explain that the dimension-changing\nfusions are understood as higher-morphisms of the higher-category describing\nthe symmetry. We also discuss how a 0-form sub-symmetry of a higher-categorical\nsymmetry can be gauged and describe the higher-categorical symmetry of the\ntheory obtained after gauging. This provides a procedure for constructing\nnon-invertible higher-categorical symmetries starting from invertible\nhigher-form or higher-group symmetries and gauging a 0-form symmetry. We\nillustrate this procedure by constructing non-invertible 2-categorical\nsymmetries in 4d gauge theories and non-invertible 3-categorical symmetries in\n5d and 6d theories.

The principle that enables this generalization is the\nidentification of symmetries with topological defects in the QFT. In these\nlectures, we provide an introduction to generalized symmetries, with a focus on\nnon-invertible symmetries. We begin with a brief overview of invertible\ngeneralized symmetries, including higher-form and higher-group symmetries, and\nthen move on to non-invertible symmetries. The main idea that underlies many\nconstructions of non-invertible symmetries is that of stacking a QFT with\ntopological QFTs (TQFTs) and then gauging a diagonal non-anomalous global\nsymmetry. The TQFTs become topological defects in the gauged theory called\n(twisted) theta defects and comprise a large class of non-invertible symmetries\nincluding condensation defects, self-duality defects, and non-invertible\nsymmetries of gauge theories with disconnected gauge groups. We will explain\nthe general principle and provide numerous concrete examples. Following this\nextensive characterization of symmetry generators, we then discuss their action\non higher-charges, i.e. extended physical operators. As we will explain, even\nfor invertible higher-form symmetries these are not only representations of the\n$p$-form symmetry group, but more generally what are called\nhigher-representations. Finally, we give an introduction to the Symmetry\nTopological Field Theory (SymTFT) and its utility in characterizing symmetries,\ntheir gauging and generalized charges.\n  Lectures prepared for the ICTP Trieste Spring School, April 2023.",

          "abstract": "It is well-known that gauging a finite 0-form symmetry in a quantum field\ntheory leads to a dual symmetry generated by topological Wilson line defects.\nThese are described by the representations of the 0-form symmetry group which\nform a 1-category. We argue that for a d-dimensional quantum field theory the\nfull set of dual symmetries one obtains is in fact much larger and is described\nby a (d-1)-category, which is formed out of lower-dimensional topological\nquantum field theories with the same 0-form symmetry. We study in detail a\n2-categorical piece of this (d-1)-category described by 2d topological quantum\nfield theories with 0-form symmetry. We further show that the objects of this\n2-category are the recently discussed 2d condensation defects constructed from\nhigher-gauging of Wilson lines. Similarly, dual symmetries obtained by gauging\nany higher-form or higher-group symmetry also form a (d-1)-category formed out\nof lower-dimensional topological quantum field theories with that higher-form\nor higher-group symmetry. A particularly interesting case is that of the\n2-category of dual symmetries associated to gauging of finite 2-group\nsymmetries, as it describes non-invertible symmetries arising from gauging\n0-form symmetries that act on (d-3)-form symmetries. Such non-invertible\nsymmetries were studied recently in the literature via other methods, and our\nresults not only agree with previous results, but our approach also provides a\nmuch simpler way of computing various properties of these non-invertible\nsymmetries. We describe how our results can be applied to compute\nnon-invertible symmetries of various classes of gauge theories with continuous\ndisconnected gauge groups in various spacetime dimensions.

For the first two, the\ncorresponding notion of classifying topos is given by restricting the use of\ngeometric morphisms to open and sub-open geometric morphisms respectively. For\nthe last one, we restrict ourselves to Boolean toposes instead. Butz and\nJohnstone proved that the first-order classifying topos of an infinitary\nfirst-order theory exists precisely when that theory does not have too many\ninfinitary first-order formulas, up to intuitionistically provable equivalence.\nWe prove similar statements for the sub-first-order and Boolean case.

This represents a wide generalization of\nthe classical adjunction between presheaves on a topological space and bundles\nover it, and allows one to interpret several constructions on sheaves and\nstacks in a geometrical way; in particular, it leads to fibrational\ndescriptions of direct and inverse images of sheaves and stacks, as well as to\na geometric understanding of the sheafification process.
