          "abstract": "With wave-particle decomposition, a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP)\nmethod has been developed for the multiscale flow simulations. The UGKWP method\ncaptures the transport process in all flow regimes without kinetic solver's\nconstraint on the numerical mesh size and time step being less than the\nparticle mean free path and collision time. In the current UGKWP method, the\ncell's Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of collision time to numerical time\nstep, is used to distribute the components in the wave-particle decomposition.\nHowever, the adaptation of particle in UGKWP is mainly for the capturing of the\nnon-equilibrium transport, and the cell's Knudsen number alone is not enough to\nidentify the non-equilibrium state. For example, in the equilibrium flow regime\nwith a Maxwellian distribution function, even at a large cell's Knudsen number,\nthe flow evolution can be still modelled by the Navier-Stokes solver.\nTherefore, to further improve the efficiency, an adaptive UGKWP (AUGKWP) method\nwill be developed with the introduction of an additional local flow variable\ngradient-dependent Knudsen number. As a result, the wave-particle decomposition\nin UGKWP will be determined by both cell's and gradient's Knudsen numbers, and\nthe particle in UGKWP is solely used to capture the non-equilibrium flow\ntransport. The AUGKWP becomes much more efficient than the previous one with\nthe cell's Knudsen number only in the determination of wave-particle\ncomposition. Many numerical tests, including Sod tube, shock structure, flow\naround a cylinder, flow around a reentry capsule, and an unsteady nozzle plume\nflow, have been conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of AUGKWP.\nCompared with the original UGKWP, the AUGKWP achieves the same accuracy but has\nadvantages in memory reduction and computational efficiency in the simulation\nfor the flow with the co-existing of multiple regimes.",

          "abstract": "This article aims at developing a high order pressure-based solver for the\nsolution of the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes system at all Mach numbers. We\npropose a cell-centered discretization of the governing equations that splits\nthe fluxes into a fast and a slow scale part, that are treated implicitly and\nexplicitly, respectively. A novel semi-implicit discretization is proposed for\nthe kinetic energy as well as the enthalpy fluxes in the energy equation, hence\navoiding any need of iterative solvers. The implicit discretization yields an\nelliptic equation on the pressure that can be solved for both ideal gas and\ngeneral equation of state (EOS). A nested Newton method is used to solve the\nmildly nonlinear system for the pressure in case of nonlinear EOS. High order\nin time is granted by implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping, whereas a novel\nCWENO technique efficiently implemented in a dimension-by-dimension manner is\ndeveloped for achieving high order in space for the discretization of explicit\nconvective and viscous fluxes. A quadrature-free finite volume solver is then\nderived for the high order approximation of numerical fluxes. Central schemes\nwith no dissipation of suitable order of accuracy are finally employed for the\nnumerical approximation of the implicit terms. Consequently, the CFL-type\nstability condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the\nfluid velocity and not on the sound speed, so that the novel schemes work\nuniformly for all Mach numbers. Convergence and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are assessed through a wide set of benchmark problems involving low and\nhigh Mach number regimes, as well as inviscid and viscous flows.",

          "abstract": "A general framework for the development of high-order compact schemes has\nbeen proposed recently. The core steps of the schemes are composed of the\nfollowing. 1). Based on a kinetic model equation, from a generalized initial\ndistribution of flow variables construct a time-accurate evolution solution of\ngas distribution function at a cell interface ; 2). Introduce the WENO-type\nweighting functions into the time-derivative of the cell interface flux\nfunction in the multistage multi-derivative time stepping scheme to cope with\nthe possible impingement of a shock wave on a cell interface within a time\nstep; 3). Take moments of interface gas distribution function to obtain the\ntime-accurate flow variables and the corresponding fluxes at the cell\ninterface, and update the cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients\ninside each control volume; 4). Within the physical domain of dependence of the\nreconstructed cell, based on the cell-averaged flow variables and their\ngradients develop compact initial data reconstruction to get initial flow\ndistributions at the beginning of next time step. A compact gas-kinetic scheme\n(GKS) up to sixth-order accuracy in space and fourth-order in time has been\nconstructed on 2D unstructured mesh before. In this paper, the compact GKS up\nto fourth-order accuracy on 3D tetrahedral mesh will be further constructed\nwith the focus on the WENO-type initial data reconstruction. Nonlinear weights\nare designed to achieve high-order accuracy for the smooth Navier-Stokes\nsolution and keep super robustness in 3D computation with strong shock\ninteractions. The fourth-order compact GKS can use a large time step with CFL\nnumber $0.6$ in the simulations from subsonic to hypersonic flow. A series of\ntest cases are used to validate the scheme. The high-order compact GKS is ready\nfor 3D applications with complex geometry.",

          "abstract": "We present two effective methods for solving high-dimensional partial\ndifferential equations (PDE) based on randomized neural networks. Motivated by\nthe universal approximation property of this type of networks, both methods\nextend the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach from low to high dimensions.\nWith the first method the unknown solution field in $d$ dimensions is\nrepresented by a randomized feed-forward neural network, in which the\nhidden-layer parameters are randomly assigned and fixed while the output-layer\nparameters are trained. The PDE and the boundary/initial conditions, as well as\nthe continuity conditions (for the local variant of the method), are enforced\non a set of random interior/boundary collocation points. The resultant linear\nor nonlinear algebraic system, through its least squares solution, provides the\ntrained values for the network parameters. With the second method the\nhigh-dimensional PDE problem is reformulated through a constrained expression\nbased on an Approximate variant of the Theory of Functional Connections\n(A-TFC), which avoids the exponential growth in the number of terms of TFC as\nthe dimension increases. The free field function in the A-TFC constrained\nexpression is represented by a randomized neural network and is trained by a\nprocedure analogous to the first method. We present ample numerical simulations\nfor a number of high-dimensional linear/nonlinear stationary/dynamic PDEs to\ndemonstrate their performance. These methods can produce accurate solutions to\nhigh-dimensional PDEs, in particular with their errors reaching levels not far\nfrom the machine accuracy for relatively lower dimensions.

With the advance of deep learning, physics-informed\nneural networks (PINNs), as a mesh-free method, have shown great potential for\nfast PDE solving in various applications. To address the issue of low accuracy\nand convergence problems of existing PINNs, we propose a self-training\nphysics-informed neural network, ST-PINN. Specifically, ST-PINN introduces a\npseudo label based self-learning algorithm during training. It employs\ngoverning equation as the pseudo-labeled evaluation index and selects the\nhighest confidence examples from the sample points to attach the pseudo labels.\nTo our best knowledge, we are the first to incorporate a self-training\nmechanism into physics-informed learning. We conduct experiments on five PDE\nproblems in different fields and scenarios. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed method allows the network to learn more physical information and\nbenefit convergence. The ST-PINN outperforms existing physics-informed neural\nnetwork methods and improves the accuracy by a factor of 1.33x-2.54x.

          "abstract": "We introduce a class of Sparse, Physics-based, and partially Interpretable\nNeural Networks (SPINN) for solving ordinary and partial differential equations\n(PDEs). By reinterpreting a traditional meshless representation of solutions of\nPDEs we develop a class of sparse neural network architectures that are\npartially interpretable. The SPINN model we propose here serves as a seamless\nbridge between two extreme modeling tools for PDEs, namely dense neural network\nbased methods like Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and traditional\nmesh-free numerical methods, thereby providing a novel means to develop a new\nclass of hybrid algorithms that build on the best of both these viewpoints. A\nunique feature of the SPINN model that distinguishes it from other neural\nnetwork based approximations proposed earlier is that it is (i) interpretable,\nin a particular sense made precise in the work, and (ii) sparse in the sense\nthat it has much fewer connections than typical dense neural networks used for\nPDEs.

Also, in order to broaden the support of nuclear\ndata libraries compatible with Geant4, a nuclear processing tool has been\ndeveloped and validated allowing the use of the code together with ENDF-BVIII.0\nand JEFF-3.3 libraries for example. These changes should be taken into account\nin an upcoming Geant4 release.",

          "abstract": "We employ Reactive Dynamical Density Functional Theory (R-DDFT) and Reactive\nBrownian Dynamics (R-BD) simulations to investigate the dynamics of a\nsuspension of active soft Gaussian colloids with binary interaction switching,\ni.e., a one-component colloidal system in which every particle stochastically\nswitches at predefined rates between two interaction states with different\nmobility. Using R-DDFT we extend a theory previously developed to access the\ndynamics of inhomogeneous liquids to study the influence of the switching\nactivity on the self and distinct part of the Van Hove function in bulk\nsolution, and determine the corresponding mean squared displacement of the\nswitching particles. Our results demonstrate that, even though the average\ndiffusion coefficient is not affected by the switching activity, it\nsignificantly modifies the non-equilibrium dynamics and diffusion coefficients\nof the individual particles, leading to a crossover from short to long times,\nwith a regime for intermediate times showing anomalous diffusion. In addition,\nthe self-part of the van Hove function has a Gaussian form at short and long\ntimes, but becomes non-Gaussian at intermediates ones, having a crossover\nbetween short and large displacements. The corresponding self-intermediate\nscattering function shows the two-step relaxation patters typically observed in\nsoft materials with heterogeneous dynamics such as glasses and gels. We also\nintroduce a phenomenological Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) theory to\nunderstand the heterogeneous diffusion of this system. R-DDFT results are in\nexcellent agreement with R-BD simulations and the analytical predictions of\nCTRW theory, thus confirming that R-DDFT constitutes a powerful method to\ninvestigate not only the structure and phase behavior, but also the dynamical\nproperties of non-equilibrium active switching colloidal suspensions.",

Previous\nwork has shown that the dynamics of rod-like or ellipsoidal active particles\ncan differ significantly from that of spherical ones. Here, we obtain the full\nstate diagram of active Brownian ellipsoids depending on the P\\'eclet number\nand packing density via computer simulations. The system is found to exhibit a\nrich state behavior that includes cluster formation, local polar order, polar\nflocks, and disordered states. Moreover, we obtain numerical results and an\nanalytical representation for the pair-distribution function of active\nellipsoids. This function provides useful quantitative insights into the\ncollective behavior of active particles with lower symmetry and has potential\napplications in the development of predictive theoretical models.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a\npivotal tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and phase behavior in\ncharged soft matter systems. To explore phenomena across greater length and\ntime scales in MD simulations, molecules are often coarse-grained for better\ncomputational performance. However, commonly-used force fields represent\nparticles as hard-core interaction centers with point charges, which often\noveremphasizes the packing effect and short-range electrostatics, especially in\nsystems with bulky deformable organic molecules and systems with strong\ncoarse-graining. This underscores the need for an efficient soft-core model to\nphysically capture the effective interactions between coarse-grained particles.\nTo this end, we implement a soft-core model uniting the Gaussian core model\nwith smeared electrostatic interactions that is phenomenologically equivalent\nto recent theoretical models. We first parameterize it generically using water\nas the model solvent. Then, we benchmark its performance in the OpenMM toolkit\nfor different boundary conditions to highlight a computational speedup of up to\n$34\\times$ compared to commonly used force fields and existing implementations.\nFinally, we demonstrate its utility by investigating how boundary\npolarizability affects the adsorption behavior of a polyelectrolyte solution on\nperfectly conducting and nonmetal electrodes.",

          "abstract": "Methods that combine collective variable (CV) based enhanced sampling and\nglobal tempering approaches are used in speeding-up the conformational sampling\nand free energy calculation of large and soft systems with a plethora of energy\nminima. In this paper, a new method of this kind is proposed in which the\nwell-sliced metadynamics approach (WSMTD) is united with Replica Exchange with\nSolute Tempering (REST2) method. WSMTD employs a divide-and-conquer strategy\nwherein high-dimensional slices of a free energy surface are independently\nsampled and combined. The method enables one to accomplish a controlled\nexploration of the CV-space with a restraining bias as in umbrella sampling\n(US), and enhance-sampling of one or more orthogonal CVs using a metadynamics\n(MTD) like bias. The new hybrid method proposed here enables boosting the\nsampling of more slow degrees of freedom in WSMTD simulations, without the need\nto specify associated CVs, through a replica exchange scheme within the\nframework of REST2. The high-dimensional slices of the probability\ndistributions of CVs computed from the united WSMTD and REST2 simulations are\nsubsequently combined using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to\nobtain the free energy surface. We show that the new method proposed here is\naccurate, improves the conformational sampling, and achieves quick convergence\nin free energy estimates. We demonstrate this by computing the conformational\nfree energy landscapes of solvated alanine tripeptide and Trp-cage mini protein\nin explicit water.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning methods provide a general framework for automatically\nfinding and representing the essential characteristics of simulation data. This\ntask is particularly crucial in enhanced sampling simulations. There we seek a\nfew generalized degrees of freedom, referred to as collective variables (CVs),\nto represent and drive the sampling of the free energy landscape. In theory,\nthese CVs should separate different metastable states and correspond to the\nslow degrees of freedom of the studied physical process. To this aim, we\npropose a new method that we call multiscale reweighted stochastic embedding\n(MRSE). Our work builds upon a parametric version of stochastic neighbor\nembedding. The technique automatically learns CVs that map a high-dimensional\nfeature space to a low-dimensional latent space via a deep neural network. We\nintroduce several new advancements to stochastic neighbor embedding methods\nthat make MRSE especially suitable for enhanced sampling simulations: (1)\nweight-tempered random sampling as a landmark selection scheme to obtain\ntraining data sets that strike a balance between equilibrium representation and\ncapturing important metastable states lying higher in free energy; (2) a\nmultiscale representation of the high-dimensional feature space via a Gaussian\nmixture probability model; and (3) a reweighting procedure to account for\ntraining data from a biased probability distribution. We show that MRSE\nconstructs low-dimensional CVs that can correctly characterize the different\nmetastable states in three model systems: the M\\\"uller-Brown potential, alanine\ndipeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.",

          "abstract": "To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,\nnumerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the\nexploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach\naccelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with pre-defined\ncollective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV\nrange. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions\nwithin the CV space. This paper introduces a novel \"sinking\" approach that\nenables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by\nproposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates\nthe effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique.\nBuilding on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which \"sinks\" the interior\nbias potential to create restraining potential \"cliffs\" at the grid edges. This\ntechnique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a preset\narea. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal\nsampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of\nvarious shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and\none-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta\nwill pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially\noffering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy\npaths in high-dimensional spaces.",
