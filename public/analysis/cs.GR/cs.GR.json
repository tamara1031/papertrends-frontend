          "abstract": "Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at\ncity scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene\n(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,\nimplicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the\nscene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications.",

          "abstract": "Rendering photo-realistic novel-view images of complex scenes has been a\nlong-standing challenge in computer graphics. In recent years, great research\nprogress has been made on enhancing rendering quality and accelerating\nrendering speed in the realm of view synthesis. However, when rendering complex\ndynamic scenes with sparse views, the rendering quality remains limited due to\nocclusion problems. Besides, for rendering high-resolution images on dynamic\nscenes, the rendering speed is still far from real-time. In this work, we\npropose a generalizable view synthesis method that can render high-resolution\nnovel-view images of complex static and dynamic scenes in real-time from sparse\nviews. To address the occlusion problems arising from the sparsity of input\nviews and the complexity of captured scenes, we introduce an explicit 3D\nvisibility reasoning approach that can efficiently estimate the visibility of\nsampled 3D points to the input views. The proposed visibility reasoning\napproach is fully differentiable and can gracefully fit inside the volume\nrendering pipeline, allowing us to train our networks with only multi-view\nimages as supervision while refining geometry and texture simultaneously.\nBesides, each module in our pipeline is carefully designed to bypass the\ntime-consuming MLP querying process and enhance the rendering quality of\nhigh-resolution images, enabling us to render high-resolution novel-view images\nin real-time.Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous\nview synthesis methods in both rendering quality and speed, particularly when\ndealing with complex dynamic scenes with sparse views.",

However, NeRF requires hundreds\nof network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral,\nmaking it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can\neffectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To\naddress these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a\nmulti-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and\nfast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The\nkey idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding\nstrategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits\nmemory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the\nfast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine\nresolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone\ntracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates\nencoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster\nrendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint\nin comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.",

Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model\ndesigned to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance.

Due to the\nhigh throughput involved in GPU-based simulations, classical visualization\napproaches such as ones based on copying to RAM or storage are not feasible\nanymore, as they imply large memory transfers between GPU and CPU at each\nmoment, reducing both computational performance and interactivity. Implementing\nreal-time visualizers for GPU simulation codes is a challenging task as it\ninvolves dealing with i) low-level integration of graphics APIs (e.g, OpenGL\nand Vulkan) into the general-purpose GPU code, ii) a careful and efficient\nhandling of memory spaces and iii) finding a balance between rendering and\ncomputing as both need the GPU resources. In this work we present M\\`imir, a\nCUDA/Vulkan interoperability C++ library that allows users to add real-time\n2D/3D visualization to CUDA codes with low programming effort.

The goal of\nthis task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and\nthe desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing\nresearch attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or\nconditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a\nlatent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite\nthe progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,\nlimited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than\n``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing.

Topology\noptimization helps reduce the waste of raw material in the fabrication of 3D\nprinted parts, thus decreasing production costs associated with manufacturing\nlighter structures.

This paper develops and tests a new method for\nhandling stress constraints in topology and fiber orientation optimization of\n3D printed orthotropic structures. The stress constraints are coupled with an\nobjective function that maximizes stiffness. This is accomplished by using the\nmodified solid isotropic material with penalization method with the method of\nmoving asymptotes as the mathematical optimizer.

To reduce the number of\nstress constraints and thus the computational cost, a new clustering strategy\nis employed in which the highest stresses in the principal material coordinates\nare grouped separately into two clusters using an adjusted $P$-norm.

To overcome the dynamics mismatch,\nwe propose a novel approach, residual force control (RFC), that augments a\nhumanoid control policy by adding external residual forces into the action\nspace.
