          "year": "2025-06",
          "abstract": "With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse\ndesign methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional\nmaterials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches\nsuffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack\nreliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the\ndesign process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert\nknowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning\nframework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data\nusing difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,\naccelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated\nrefinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects\nprediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and\nstate value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function\nleverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during\ntraining. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses\ntraditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery\nefficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates\nproposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based\nalloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\\%\nelongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately\ncaptured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating\nits reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.",

          "year": "2025-08",
          "abstract": "While traditional trial-and-error methods for designing amorphous alloys are\ncostly and inefficient, machine learning approaches based solely on composition\nlack critical atomic structural information. Machine learning interatomic\npotentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a\npowerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional\npotential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a\ngeneral-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by\nusing a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary\nand ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent\npredictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error\nof 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\\r{A} for forces.

          "abstract": "A continuum model of fracture that describes, in principle, the propagation\nand interaction of arbitrary distributions of cracks and voids with evolving\ntopology without a fracture criterion is developed. It involves a 'law of\nmotion' for crack-tips, primarily as a kinematical consequence coupled with\nthermodynamics. Fundamental kinematics endows the crack-tip with a topological\ncharge. This allows the association of a kinematical conservation law for the\ncharge, resulting in a fundamental evolution equation for the crack-tip field,\nand in turn the crack field. The vectorial crack field degrades the elastic\nmodulus in a physically justified anisotropic manner. The mathematical\nstructure of this conservation law allows an additive 'free' gradient of a\nscalar field in the evolution of the crack field. We associate this naturally\nemerging scalar field with the porosity that arises in the modeling of ductile\nfailure. Thus, porosity-rate gradients affect the evolution of the crack-field\nwhich, then, naturally degrades the elastic modulus, and it is through this\nfundamental mechanism that spatial gradients in porosity growth affects the\nstrain-energy density and stress carrying capacity of the material - and, as a\ndimensional consequence related to fundamental kinematics, introduces a\nlength-scale in the model. The key hypothesis of this work is that brittle\nfracture is energy-driven while ductile fracture is stress-driven; under\noverall shear loadings where mean stress vanishes or is compressive, shear\nstrain energy can still drive shear fracture in ductile materials.",

Using hafnia as example, we show that multiple-order-parameter\nnature not only provides various mobile domain walls and defect-like immobile\ndomain walls, but also enables the domain wall reactions. In analogy with\nchemical reactions where substances react to form new substances, domain walls\ncould also react to form other domain walls during switching. We identify\nseveral elementary domain wall reaction types including synthesis,\ndecomposition, and exchange reactions. Domain walls are continually changed by\nthese reactions during switching so that the switching behavior reflects the\nstatistical average of many domain wall types with distinct mobility and\nstability. These reactions also lead to phenomenon like remanent nuclei and\ndefect site nucleation that facilitate switching and lower coercive field.\nFinally, the concept of domain wall reaction is not limited to hafnia but can\nbe generalized to any multiple-order-parameter ferroelectric. This work\nconceptualizes domain wall reaction, expands theory of ferroelectric switching,\nand suggests a practical way for defect engineering to control switching\nbehavior.",

Here we\ndemonstrate volatile ferroelectric switching of Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ at room\ntemperature and see that initial polarization orientation strongly determines\nthe properties of polarization switching. In particular, polarization switching\nhysteresis is strongly imprinted by the original polarization state, shifting\nthe regions of non-linearity toward zero-bias. As a corollary, polarization\nswitching also enables effective capacitive switching, approaching the\nsought-after regime of memcapacitance. Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations\ndemonstrate that one mechanism by which polarization can control the shape of\nthe hysteresis loop is the existence of charged domain walls decorating the\nperiphery of the repolarization nucleus. These walls oppose the growth of the\nswitched domain and favor back-switching, thus creating a scenario of\ncontrolled volatile ferroelectric switching. Although the measurements were\ncarried out with single crystals, prospectively volatile polarization switching\ncan be tuned by tailoring sample thickness, domain wall mobility and electric\nfields, paving way to non-linear dielectric properties for smart electronic\ncircuits.",

Based on our results, we suggest that Fe$_2$NiZn, Fe$_2$NiTi and\nNi$_2$CoFe are potential candidates for permanent magnets with large\nout-of-plane magnetic anisotropy (1.23, 0.97 and 0.82 MJ/m$^3$ respectively)\nand high Curie temperatures lying more than 200 K above the room temperature.\nWe further show that the magnitude and direction of anisotropy is very\nsensitive to the strain by calculating the values of anisotropy energy for\nseveral tetragonal phases. Thus, application of strain can be used to tune the\nanisotropy in these compounds.",

We observe a structural phase transition from the body-centered\ntetragonal structure above 70% Co concentration and confirm the structural\nstability of Fe-Co-C alloys in the tetragonal range. We show the presence of a\nbroad MAE maximum of around 50% Co concentration and notably high MAE values\nfor Co content $x$ as low as 25%.

A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the full\nconcentration ranges of hexagonal ($\\epsilon$) and orthorhombic ($\\theta$)\nphases of (Fe-Co)$_3$C, (Fe-Co)$_3$(B-C), (Fe-Co)$_3$(C-N), and their alloys\nwith 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. The calculations were performed\nusing the density functional theory implemented in the full-potential\nlocal-orbital code (FPLO). Calculated properties included formation energies,\nCurie temperatures, magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies\n(MAE), and magnetic hardnesses. The considered compositions exhibit a range of\nmagnetic properties, including soft, semi-hard, and hard magnetic. The\nmaterials most promising for hard-magnetic applications are orthorhombic\nCo$_3$C compound, together with selected Co-rich orthorhombic (Fe,Co)$_3$C and\nhexagonal (Fe,Co)$_3$C alloys.

A significant drawback of alloying orthorhombic\n$\\theta$-Fe$_3$C (cementite) with transition metals is the notable decline in\nthe Curie temperature. We found that a considerable proportion of the\northorhombic Co$_3$(B-C-N) alloys are magnetically hard, of which boron\nsubstitution raises the Curie temperature and improves stability. By mapping\nthe dependence of MAE on the concentration of elements covering both the 3$d$\n(from Fe to Co) and 2$p$ (from B, through C, to N) positions, we have\ndemonstrated for the first time the near isoelectronic nature of MAE.

We find that while the main structural distortions of the\nkagome lattice in the staggered tri-hexagonal CDW phase are along the\nnearest-neighbor V-V bonds, distortions associated with the Sb ions play a\ndefining role in the energy gain in this and all other CDW states. Moreover,\nthe coupling between ionic displacements from different unit cells is small,\nthus explaining the existence of multiple CDW instabilities with different\nmodulations along the c-axis.
