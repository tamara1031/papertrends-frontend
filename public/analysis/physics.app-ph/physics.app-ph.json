          "abstract": "The silicon nitride integration platform has been successful at realizing\nextremely low waveguide losses across the visible to infrared and components\nincluding high performance lasers, filters, resonators, stabilization cavities,\nand optical frequency combs. Yet, progress towards implementing low loss, low\npower modulators in the silicon nitride platform, while maintaining the planar,\nwafer-scale process compatibility has been limited. Here we report a\nsignificant advance in integration of a piezo-electric (PZT) actuated\nmicro-ring modulation in a fully-planar, wafer-scale silicon nitride platform,\nthat maintains low optical loss (0.03 dB/cm in a 625 um resonator) at 1550 nm,\nwith an order of magnitude increase in bandwidth (DC to 20 MHz 3-dB) and order\nof magnitude lower power consumption of 20 nW improvement over prior PZT\nmodulators. The modulator provides a >14 dB ER and 7.1 million Q over the\nentire 4 GHz tuning range, a tuning efficiency of 200 MHz/V, and delivers the\nlinearity required for control applications with 65.1 dBHz2/3 and 73.8 dBHz2/3\nIMD3 SFDR at 1 MHz and 10 MHz respectively. We demonstrate two control\napplications, laser stabilization in a PDH lock loop, reducing laser frequency\nnoise by 40 dB, and as a laser carrier tracking filter. This PZT modulator\ndesign can be extended to the visible in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride\nplatform with minor waveguide design changes. This integration of PZT\nmodulation in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide platform enables\nmodulator control functions in a wide range of visible to IR applications such\nas atomic and molecular transition locking for cooling, controllable optical\nfrequency combs, low-power external cavity tunable lasers, atomic clocks, and\ntunable ultra-low linewidth lasers and ultra-low phase noise microwave\nsynthesizers.",

Chip-scale\nintegration miniaturizes bulk implementations onto photonic chips, offering\nhighly compact, stable, and power-efficient frequency comb sources. State of\nthe art integrated frequency comb sources are based on resonantly-enhanced Kerr\neffect and, more recently, on electro-optic effect. While the former can\nroutinely reach octave-spanning bandwidths and the latter feature\nmicrowave-rate spacings, achieving both in the same material platform has been\nchallenging. Here, we leverage both strong Kerr nonlinearity and efficient\nelectro-optic phase modulation available in the ultralow-loss thin-film lithium\nniobate photonic platform, to demonstrate a hybrid Kerr-electro-optic frequency\ncomb with stabilized spacing. In our approach, a dissipative Kerr soliton is\nfirst generated, and then electro-optic division is used to realize a frequency\ncomb with 2,589 comb lines spaced by 29.308 GHz and spanning 75.9 THz (588 nm)\nend-to-end.

          "abstract": "Electrical manipulation of spins is essential to design state-of-the-art\nspintronic devices and commonly relies on the spin current injected from a\nsecond heavy-metal material. The fact that chiral antiferromagnets produce spin\ncurrent inspires us to explore the magnetization switching of chiral spins\nusing self-generated spin torque. Here, we demonstrate the electric switching\nof noncollinear antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn by observing a crossover from\nconventional spin-orbit torque to the self-generated spin torque when\nincreasing the MgO thickness in Ta/MgO/Mn3Sn polycrystalline films. The spin\ncurrent injection from the Ta layer can be controlled and even blocked by\nvarying the MgO thickness, but the switching sustains even at a large MgO\nthickness. Furthermore, the switching polarity reverses when the MgO thickness\nexceeds around 3 nm, which cannot be explained by the spin-orbit torque\nscenario due to spin current injection from the Ta layer. Evident\ncurrent-induced switching is also observed in MgO/Mn3Sn and Ti/Mn3Sn bilayers,\nwhere external injection of spin Hall current to Mn3Sn is negligible. The\ninter-grain spin-transfer torque induced by spin-polarized current explains the\nexperimental observations.

          "abstract": "The Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit, introduced by W. Shockley and H. J.\nQueisser in 1961, is the most well-established fundamental efficiency limit for\nsingle-junction photovoltaic solar cells. For widely-studied semiconductors\nsuch as Si, GaAs and lead-halide perovskite, the SQ limits under standard solar\nillumination (1-sun) are 32.7%, 32.5% and 31% for bandgaps of 1.12 eV, 1.43 eV\nand 1.55 eV, respectively.

Such\nenhancement is possible through the containment of luminescent photons within\nthe solar cell, allowing the suppression of both non-radiative and radiative\nrecombination losses, which were considered inevitable in the classical SQ\nmodel. Importantly, restricting photon emission from the solar cells raises the\nopen-circuit voltage (VOC) to values approaching the semiconductor bandgaps,\nsurpassing the theoretical VOC values predicted by the SQ model.

Bifacial solar operation with\nharvesting additional light impinging on the module back and the\nperovskite/silicon tandem device architecture are among the most promising\napproaches for further increasing the energy yield from a limited area.

Using the outcomes of this\napproach, we fabricate and characterize ultra-coherent nanomechanical\nresonators with record-high Qf products, entering a quantum coherent regime\nwhere coherent oscillations are observed at room temperature. Further\nrefinements to the model describing the mechanical system are likely to improve\nthe Qf product even more. The proposed approach - which can be also used to\nimprove phononic crystal and coupled-mode resonators - opens up a new paradigm\nfor designing ultra-coherent micro- and nanomechanical resonators for\ncutting-edge technology, enabling e.g. novel experiments in fundamental physics\n(e.g. search for dark matter and quantum nature of gravity) and extreme sensing\nof magnetic fields, electric fields and mass with unprecedented sensitivities\nat room temperature.",

Increasing crack tortuosity is connected to enhancement\nof fracture toughness, while often a crack may even be stopped when it impinges\na void, which releases the stress concentration. Therefore, the determination\nof crack trajectories is important in the design against failure of materials\nand mechanical pieces.

This belief is\nexamined through a comparison between simulations and photoelastic experiments\non PMMA plates, which have been designed in a new way, to highlight the effects\nof notches and circular holes on fracture propagation. The latter is shown to\ninitiate from a notch and to be strongly attracted by voids. When a void is\nhit, fracture is arrested, unless the void contains a notch on its internal\nsurface, from which a new crack nucleates and propagates. Different mechanical\nmodels are tested where fracture initiates and grows (i.) under Mode I compact\ntension, (ii.) four-point bending and (iii.) a tensile stress indirectly\ngenerated during compression of samples containing a circular hole. The\nexperiments show that the fracture propagation may be designed to develop in\ndifferent tortuous paths, involving multiple arrests and secondary nucleation.\nSimulations performed with an ad hoc implemented version of the AT1 and AT2\nphase-field methods (equipped with spectral decomposition, in which a crack is\nsimulated as a highly localized zone of damage accumulation) are shown to be in\nclose agreement with experiments and therefore confirm the validity of the\napproach and its potentialities for mechanical design.",

The liquid regulation mechanism\ncan then be employed in condensation and aerosol processes to generate enhanced\nflow, while the solid geometry needed to create this capillary flow itself is\ncapable of affecting and enhancing liquid generation. Ultimately, the surface\ndesign framework can be customized to each unique application to optimize\nprocesses in HVAC, industrial steam generation, chemical depositions, and\natmospheric water harvesting.",

          "abstract": "This paper reports the dynamic wetting behavior and heat transfer\ncharacteristics for impinging droplets on heated bi-phobic surfaces\n(superhydrophobic matrix with hydrophobic spots). A non-patterned\nsuperhydrophobic and a sticky hydrophobic surface acted as control wettability\nsurfaces. As expected, differences in wetting and heat transfer dynamics were\nnoticeable for all surfaces, with the most pronounced variation during the\nreceding phase. During spreading, inertia from the impact dominated the droplet\ndynamics and heat transfer was dominated by convection at the contact line and\ninternal flow. As contact line velocities decreased over time, evaporative\ncooling at the contact line gained importance, especially for the bi-phobic\nsurfaces, where liquid remained trapped on the hydrophobic spots during\nreceding. These satellite droplets increased the contact area and contact line\nlength, and assisted heat transfer and substrate cooling after lift-off of the\nmain droplet. Compared with the hydrophobic surface, the contribution of the\ncontact line heat transfer increased by 17 to 27% on the bi-phobic surfaces,\ndepending on the location of impact relative to the hydrophobic spots.\nNonetheless, the bi-phobic surfaces had a lower total thermal energy transfer.\nHowever, compared with the plain superhydrophobic surface, heat transfer was\nenhanced by 33% to 46% by patterning the surface. Depending on the application,\na trade-off exists between the different surfaces: the sticky hydrophobic\nsurface provides the best cooling efficiency, yet is prone to flooding, whereas\nthe superhydrophobic surface repels the liquid, but has poor cooling\nefficiency. The bi-phobic surfaces provide a middle path with reasonable\ncooling effectiveness and low flooding probability.",
