          "abstract": "Exposure to laser light alters cell culture examination via optical\nmicroscopic imaging techniques, also based on label-free coherent digital\nholography. To mitigate this detrimental feature, researchers tend to use a\nbroader spectrum and lower intensity of illumination, which can decrease the\nquality of holographic imaging due to lower resolution and higher noise. We\nstudy the lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) ability to operate in\nthe low photon budget (LPB) regime to enable imaging of unimpaired live cells\nwith minimized sample interaction. Low-cost off-the-shelf components are used,\npromoting the usability of such a straightforward approach. We show that\nrecording data in the LPB regime (down to 7 uW of illumination power) does not\nlimit the contrast nor resolution of the hologram phase and amplitude\nreconstruction compared to the regular illumination. The LPB generates hardware\ncamera shot noise, however, to be effectively minimized via numerical\ndenoising. The ability to obtain high-quality, high-resolution optical complex\nfield reconstruction was confirmed using the USAF 1951 amplitude sample, phase\nresolution test target, and finally, live glial restricted progenitor cells (as\na challenging strongly absorbing and scattering biomedical sample). The\nproposed approach based on severely limiting the photon budget in lensless\nholographic microscopy method can open new avenues in high-throughout (optimal\nresolution, large field-of-view and high signal-to-noise-ratio single-hologram\nreconstruction) cell culture imaging with minimized sample interaction.",

          "abstract": "Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a valuable label-free modality that has\ngained significant interest due to its wide potentials, from basic biology to\nclinical applications. Most existing QPI systems measure microscopic objects\nvia interferometry or nonlinear iterative phase reconstructions from intensity\nmeasurements. However, all imaging systems compromise spatial resolution for\nfield of view and vice versa, i.e., suffer from a limited space bandwidth\nproduct. Current solutions to this problem involve computational phase\nretrieval algorithms, which are time-consuming and often suffer from\nconvergence problems. In this article, we presented synthetic aperture\ninterference light (SAIL) microscopy as a novel modality for high-resolution,\nwide field of view QPI. The proposed approach employs low-coherence\ninterferometry to directly measure the optical phase delay under different\nillumination angles and produces large space-bandwidth product (SBP) label-free\nimaging. We validate the performance of SAIL on standard samples and illustrate\nthe biomedical applications on various specimens: pathology slides, entire\ninsects, and dynamic live cells in large cultures. The reconstructed images\nhave a synthetic numeric aperture of 0.45, and a field of view of 2.6 x 2.6\nmm2. Due to its direct measurement of the phase information, SAIL microscopy\ndoes not require long computational time, eliminates data redundancy, and\nalways converges.",

By engineering losses that break the symmetry protecting a topological\nHermitian phase, we show that a new genuinely non-Hermitian symmetry emerges,\nwhich protects and selects one of the boundary modes: the topological monomode.\nMoreover, the topology of the non-Hermitian system can be characterized by an\neffective Hermitian Hamiltonian in a higher dimension. To corroborate the\ntheory, we experimentally investigated the non-Hermitian 1D and 2D SSH models\nusing photonic lattices and observed dynamically generated monomodes in both\ncases.

          "abstract": "Photonic topological edge states in one-dimensional dimer chains have long\nbeen thought to be robust to structural perturbations by mapping the\ntopological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of a solid-state system. However, the\nedge states at the two ends of a finite topological dimer chain will interact\nas a result of near-field coupling. This leads to deviation from topological\nprotection by the chiral symmetry from the exact zero energy, weakening the\nrobustness of the topological edge state. With the aid of non-Hermitian\nphysics, the splitting frequencies of edge states can be degenerated again and\ntopological protection recovered by altering the gain or loss strength of the\nstructure. This point of coalescence is known as the exceptional point (EP).\nThe intriguing physical properties of EPs in topological structures give rise\nto many fascinating and counterintuitive phenomena. In this work, based on a\nfinite non-Hermitian dimer chain composed of ultra-subwavelength resonators, we\npropose theoretically and verify experimentally that the sensitivity of\ntopological edge states is greatly affected when the system passes through the\nEP. Using the EP of a non-Hermitian dimer chain, we realize a new sensor that\nis sensitive to perturbation at the end of the structure and yet topologically\nprotected from internal perturbation.

          "abstract": "Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects,\nintegrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon\nmanufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance,\nwafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride\nphotonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low\nmodulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However,\nin spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium\nniobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias\ninstability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate\ncan overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient,\nsignificantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage\nthreshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale\nheterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon\nnitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement\nmodulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature\nprocessing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the\nultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting\ndevices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of\nup to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ)\nmodulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581\nGbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium\ntantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended\noptical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF\nphotonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.",

Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are\none of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting\nradiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for\nXUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence\non the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored\nexperimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield\nwas optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and\nthe corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic\nmeasurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving\nlaser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS,\nwe are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found\nthat for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of\nharmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration.\nHowever, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the\nharmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.",

Moreover, unless a design space of high-performance\ndevices is known in advance, such gradient-based optimizers can get trapped in\nlocal minima valleys or saddle points, which limits performance achievable\nthrough this inverse design process. To elucidate the relationships between\ndevice performance and nanoscale structuring while mitigating the effects of\nlocal minima trapping, we present an inverse design framework that combines\nadjoint optimization, automated machine learning (AutoML), and explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI). Integrated with a numerical electromagnetics\nsimulation method, our framework reveals structural contributions towards a\nfigure-of-merit (FOM) of interest. Through an explanation-based reoptimization\nprocess, this information is then leveraged to minimize the FOM further than\nthat obtained through adjoint optimization alone, thus overcoming the\noptimization's local minima.
