          "year": "2022-01",
          "abstract": "The peculiarity of adversarial team games resides in the asymmetric\ninformation available to the team members during the play, which makes the\nequilibrium computation problem hard even with zero-sum payoffs. The algorithms\navailable in the literature work with implicit representations of the strategy\nspace and mainly resort to Linear Programming and column generation techniques\nto enlarge incrementally the strategy space. Such representations prevent the\nadoption of standard tools such as abstraction generation, game solving, and\nsubgame solving, which demonstrated to be crucial when solving huge, real-world\ntwo-player zero-sum games. Differently from these works, we answer the question\nof whether there is any suitable game representation enabling the adoption of\nthose tools. In particular, our algorithms convert a sequential team game with\nadversaries to a classical two-player zero-sum game. In this converted game,\nthe team is transformed into a single coordinator player who only knows\ninformation common to the whole team and prescribes to the players an action\nfor any possible private state. Interestingly, we show that our game is more\nexpressive than the original extensive-form game as any state/action\nabstraction of the extensive-form game can be captured by our representation,\nwhile the reverse does not hold. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the\nresulting Public Team game may be exponentially larger than the original one.\nTo limit this explosion, we provide three algorithms, each returning an\ninformation-lossless abstraction that dramatically reduces the size of the\ntree. These abstractions can be produced without generating the original game\ntree. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting\nexperimental results on Kuhn and Leduc Poker games, obtained by applying\nstate-of-art algorithms for two-player zero-sum games on the converted games",

          "year": "2025-04",
          "abstract": "Nash equilibrium is perhaps the best-known solution concept in game theory.\nSuch a solution assigns a strategy to each player which offers no incentive to\nunilaterally deviate. While a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to always exist,\nthe problem of finding one in general-sum games is PPAD-complete, generally\nconsidered intractable. Regret minimization is an efficient framework for\napproximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. However, in\ngeneral-sum games, such algorithms are only guaranteed to converge to a\ncoarse-correlated equilibrium (CCE), a solution concept where players can\ncorrelate their strategies. In this work, we use meta-learning to minimize the\ncorrelations in strategies produced by a regret minimizer. This encourages the\nregret minimizer to find strategies that are closer to a Nash equilibrium. The\nmeta-learned regret minimizer is still guaranteed to converge to a CCE, but we\ngive a bound on the distance to Nash equilibrium in terms of our meta-loss. We\nevaluate our approach in general-sum imperfect information games. Our\nalgorithms provide significantly better approximations of Nash equilibria than\nstate-of-the-art regret minimization techniques.",

          "year": "2021-10",
          "abstract": "Two player zero sum simultaneous action games are common in video games,\nfinancial markets, war, business competition, and many other settings. We first\nintroduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning in two player zero\nsum simultaneous action games and discuss the unique challenges this type of\ngame poses. Then we introduce two novel agents that attempt to handle these\nchallenges by using joint action Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The first agent, called\nthe Best Response AgenT (BRAT), builds an explicit model of its opponent's\npolicy using imitation learning, and then uses this model to find the best\nresponse to exploit the opponent's strategy. The second agent, Meta-Nash DQN,\nbuilds an implicit model of its opponent's policy in order to produce a context\nvariable that is used as part of the Q-value calculation. An explicit minimax\nover Q-values is used to find actions close to Nash equilibrium. We find\nempirically that both agents converge to Nash equilibrium in a self-play\nsetting for simple matrix games, while also performing well in games with\nlarger state and action spaces. These novel algorithms are evaluated against\nvanilla RL algorithms as well as recent state of the art multi-agent and two\nagent algorithms. This work combines ideas from traditional reinforcement\nlearning, game theory, and meta learning.",

          "year": "2023-06",
          "abstract": "We study information design in click-through auctions, in which the\nbidders/advertisers bid for winning an opportunity to show their ads but only\npay for realized clicks. The payment may or may not happen, and its probability\nis called the click-through rate (CTR). This auction format is widely used in\nthe industry of online advertising. Bidders have private values, whereas the\nseller has private information about each bidder's CTRs. We are interested in\nthe seller's problem of partially revealing CTR information to maximize\nrevenue. Information design in click-through auctions turns out to be\nintriguingly different from almost all previous studies in this space since any\nrevealed information about CTRs will never affect bidders' bidding behaviors --\nthey will always bid their true value per click -- but only affect the\nauction's allocation and payment rule. In some sense, this makes information\ndesign effectively a constrained mechanism design problem.\n  Our first result is an FPTAS to compute an approximately optimal mechanism\nunder a constant number of bidders. The design of this algorithm leverages\nBayesian bidder values which help to ``smooth'' the seller's revenue function\nand lead to better tractability. The design of this FPTAS is complex and\nprimarily algorithmic. Our second main result pursues the design of ``simple''\nmechanisms that are approximately optimal yet more practical. We primarily\nfocus on the two-bidder situation, which is already notoriously challenging as\ndemonstrated in recent works. When bidders' CTR distribution is symmetric, we\ndevelop a simple prior-free signaling scheme, whose construction relies on a\nparameter termed optimal signal ratio.

Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction\nformat $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item\nauctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be\npaid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the\nprior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of\nrealized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism\nusing a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many\ncommon non-truthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and\nextends the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16] beyond truthful auctions.\n  Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as\nsimultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay\nauctions. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue\nguarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments,\naddressing an open question in the literature [RST17]. If all-pay auctions are\nused, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that\nthe auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after\nobserving agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for\nmulti-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal\nrevenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful\n$O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning\nvia online learning techniques.",

          "year": "2024-01",
          "abstract": "The popularization of distributed energy resources transforms end-users from\nconsumers into prosumers. Inspired by the sharing economy principle, energy\nsharing markets for prosumers are proposed to facilitate the utilization of\nrenewable energy. This paper proposes a novel two-layer energy sharing market\nfor massive prosumers, which can promote social efficiency by wider-area\nsharing. In this market, there is an upper-level wide-area market (WAM) in the\ndistribution system and numerous lower-level local-area markets (LAMs) in\ncommunities. Prosumers in the same community share energy with each other in\nthe LAM, which can be uncleared. The energy surplus and shortage of LAMs are\ncleared in the WAM. Thanks to the wide-area two-layer structure, the market\noutcome is near-social-optimal in large-scale systems. However, the proposed\nmarket forms a complex mathematical program with equilibrium constraints\n(MPEC). To solve the problem, we propose an efficient and hierarchically\ndistributed bidding algorithm. The proposed two-layer market and bidding\nalgorithm are verified on the IEEE 123-bus system with 11250 prosumers, which\ndemonstrates the practicality and efficiency for large-scale markets.",

          "title": "Microgrids Coalitions for Energy Market Balancing",
          "year": "2025-06",
          "abstract": "With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution\nnetworks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy\nmarket has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may\nface imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability\nat the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal\ncoalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or\nsupply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient\nmanagement of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that\nidentify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of\nthe energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the\noptimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a\nstrategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An\nindividual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of\npopulation of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and\nmutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total\nvalue generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when\nthe energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the\nenergy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the\nprofit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during\nperiods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy\non the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the\ntrading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,\naccording to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to\nthe formation of collective value.",

          "title": "Social Factors in P2P Energy Trading Using Hedonic Games",
          "year": "2023-09",
          "abstract": "Lately, the energy communities have gained a lot of attention as they have\nthe potential to significantly contribute to the resilience and flexibility of\nthe energy system, facilitating widespread integration of intermittent\nrenewable energy sources. Within these communities the prosumers can engage in\npeer-to-peer trading, fostering local collaborations and increasing awareness\nabout energy usage and flexible consumption. However, even under these\nfavorable conditions, prosumer engagement levels remain low, requiring trading\nmechanisms that are aligned with their social values and expectations. In this\npaper, we introduce an innovative hedonic game coordination and cooperation\nmodel for P2P energy trading among prosumers which considers the social\nrelationships within an energy community to create energy coalitions and\nfacilitate energy transactions among them. We defined a heuristic that\noptimizes the prosumers coalitions, considering their social and energy price\npreferences and balancing the energy demand and supply within the community. We\nintegrated the proposed hedonic game model into a state-of-the-art\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market and evaluated its performance\nwithin an energy community of prosumers. The evaluation results on a\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market show the effectiveness in\nconsidering social factors when creating coalitions, increasing the total\namount of energy transacted in a market session by 5% compared with other game\ntheory-based solutions. Finally, it shows the importance of the social\ndimensions of P2P energy transactions, the positive social dynamics in the\nenergy community increasing the amount of energy transacted by more than 10%\nwhile contributing to a more balanced energy demand and supply within the\ncommunity.",
