We present the concept of a quaihyperbolic\nvisibility domain (QH-visibility domain) for domains that meet the visibility\nproperty in relation to the quasihyperbolic metric. By utilizing this\nvisibility property, we offer a comprehensive solution to this problem. Indeed,\nwe prove that such domains are precisely the QH-visibility domains that have no\ngeodesic loops in the Euclidean closure. Furthermore, we establish a general\ncriterion for a domain to be the QH-visibility domain. Using this criterion,\none can determine that uniform domains, John domains, and domains that satisfy\nquasihyperbolic boundary conditions are QH-visibility domains. We also compare\nthe visibility of hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic metrics for planar hyperbolic\ndomains. As an application of the visibility property, we study the\nhomeomorphic extension of quasiconformal maps. Moreover, we also study the\nQH-visibility of unbounded domains in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

Our recent work introduces path-slice stem\nfunctions, along with a novel $*$-product, tailored for weakly slice regular\nfunctions. This innovation allows us to explore new techniques for conjugating\nand symmetrizing path-slice functions. A key finding of our study is the\ndiscovery that the zeroes of a path-slice function are comprehensively\nencapsulated within the zeroes of its symmetrized counterpart. This insight is\nparticularly significant in the context of path-slice stem functions. We\nestablish that for weakly slice regular functions, the processes of conjugation\nand symmetrization gain prominence once the function's slice regularity is\naffirmed. Furthermore, our investigation sheds light on the intricate nature of\nthe zeroes of a slice regular function. We ascertain that these zeroes\nconstitute a path-slice analytic set.

It is noteworthy that this\n$*$-product is directly applicable to weakly slice regular functions, as every\nslice regular function defined on a slice-open set inherently possesses\npath-slice properties. Building on this foundation, we propose a precise\ndefinition of an open neighborhood for a path $\\gamma$ in the path space\n$\\mathscr{P}(\\mathbb{C}^n)$. This definition is pivotal in establishing the\nholomorphism of stem functions. Consequently, we demonstrate that the\n$*$-product of two weakly slice regular functions retains its weakly slice\nregular nature.

It is a random curve\nin two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is\nsupposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for\nSLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected\ndomain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial,\na random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point.\nMultiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random\ncurves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster\ninterfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple\nSLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.\n  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple\nSLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been\nextensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many\nrecent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF\noccurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson\nBrownian motions.\n  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic\nlog-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the\ncorresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large\nnumbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity.
