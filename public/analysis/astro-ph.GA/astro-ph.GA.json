We aim to investigate one of the least studied s-process elements in\nthe literature, Ce, using stars with asteroseismic constraints from the Kepler,\nK2 and TESS missions. We combine the global asteroseismic parameters derived\nfrom precise light curves obtained by the Kepler, K2 and TESS missions with\nchemical abundances from the APOGEE DR17 survey and astrometric data from the\nGaia mission. Finally, we compute stellar ages using the code PARAM. We\ninvestigate the different trends of [Ce/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe]\nand age considering the dependence on the radial position, specially in the\ncase of K2 targets which cover a large Galactocentric range. We, finally,\nexplore the [Ce/alpha] ratios as a function of age in different Galactocentric\nintervals. The studied trends display a strong dependence of the Ce abundances\non [Fe/H] and star formation history. Indeed, the [Ce/Fe] ratio shows a\nnon-monotonic dependence on [Fe/H] with a peak around -0.2 dex. Moreover,\nyounger stars have higher [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] ratios than older stars,\nconfirming the latest contribution of low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic\ngiant branch stars to the Galactic chemical enrichment. In addition, the trends\nof [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] with age become steeper moving towards the outer\nregions of the Galactic disc, demonstrating a more intense star formation in\nthe inner regions than in the outer regions. Ce is thus a potentially\ninteresting element to help constraining stellar yields and the inside-out\nformation of the Milky Way disc. However, the large scatter in all the\nrelations studied here, suggests that spectroscopic uncertainties for this\nelement are still too large.",

One Na-rich star ([Na/Fe] = +1.14) with low [Mg/Fe]\nsuggests a possible chemical connection with second-generation stars in a\nglobular cluster. The progenitor of an extremely Na-poor star ([Na/Fe] = -1.02)\nwith an enhancement of K- and Ni-abundance ratios may have undergone a distinct\nnucleosynthesis episode, associated with core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)\nhaving a high explosion energy. We have also found a Mg-rich star ([Mg/Fe] =\n+0.73) with slightly enhanced Na and extremely low [Ba/Fe], indicating that its\norigin is not associated with neutron-capture events. On the other hand, the\norigin of the lowest Mg abundance ([Mg/Fe] = -0.61) star could be explained by\naccretion from a dwarf galaxy, or formation in a gas cloud largely polluted by\nSNe Ia. We have also explored the progenitor masses of our EMP stars by\ncomparing their chemical-abundance patterns with those predicted by Population\nIII SNe models, and find a mass range of 10 - 26 $M_\\odot$, suggesting that\nsuch stars were primarily responsible for the chemical enrichment of the early\nMilky Way.",

To address these questions, we\ninvestigated twelve high-mass star-forming regions using the ALMA band 6\nobservations.

Up to 19 COMs are\nidentified including oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and their\nisotopologues in cores. The derived abundances show a good agreement with those\nfrom other low- and high-mass star-forming regions, implying that the COMs\nchemistry is predominantly set by the ice chemistry in the prestellar core\nstage. One clear trend is that the COMs detection rate steeply grows with the\ngas column density, which can be attributed to the efficient formation of COMs\nin dense cores. In addition, cores associated with a 6.7 GHz class II\nCH$_{3}$OH maser tend to be enriched with COMs. Finally, our results suggest\nthat the enhanced abundances of several molecules in our hot cores could be\noriginated by the active accretion as well as different physical conditions of\ncores.",

In our previous work, we found that a large fraction (~25%)\nof the quasars in this sample are X-ray underluminous by factors of >3-10. As\nabsorbing columns of >10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be safely ruled out, their\nweakness is most likely intrinsic. Here we explore possible correlations\nbetween the UV and X-ray features of these sources to investigate the origin of\nX-ray weakness. We fit their UV SDSS spectra and analyse their CIV properties\n(e.g., equivalent width, EW; line peak velocity, $\\upsilon_{\\rm peak}$) as a\nfunction of the X-ray photon index and 2-10 keV flux. We confirm the trends of\nCIV $\\upsilon_{\\rm peak}$ and EW with UV luminosity at 2500 angstrom for both\nX-ray weak and X-ray normal quasars, as well as the correlation between X-ray\nweakness and CIV EW. In contrast to some recent work, we do not observe any\nclear relation between the 2-10 keV luminosity and $\\upsilon_{\\rm peak}$. We\nfind a correlation between the hard X-ray flux and the integrated CIV flux for\nX-ray normal quasars, whilst X-ray weak quasars deviate from the main trend by\nmore than 0.5 dex. We argue that X-ray weakness might be interpreted in a\nstarved X-ray corona picture associated with an ongoing disc-wind phase. If the\nwind is ejected in the vicinity of the black hole, the extreme-UV radiation\nthat reaches the corona will be depleted, depriving the corona of seeds photons\nand generating an X-ray weak quasar. Yet, at the largest UV luminosities\n(>10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), there will still be an ample reservoir of ionising\nphotons that can explain the excess CIV emission observed in the X-ray weak\nquasars with respect to normal sources of similar X-ray luminosities.",

The simple explanation of OD AGN's nature is due to a bright host\ngalaxy that dilutes the AGN light or dust materials obscuring the AGN light.\nThe bright host galaxy dilution explains nearly $70\\%$ of our OD AGN sample. At\nthe same time, the dust material obscuration is unlikely for the main reason.\nBy estimating the Eddington ratio, we also found that 95/180 of our OD AGNs\nhave a lower accretion rate of $(\\lambda_\\text{Edd})\\lesssim 10^{-2}$ than the\ntypical AGN value. We expected the lower accretion rate sources that suffer\nfrom neither host galaxy dilution nor obscuration to have Radiatively\nInefficient Flow (RIAF) in their accretion disk.

Therefore, if the correlations between dark matter mass\ndensities as a function of the distances between them are measured via\nobservations, we can scrutinize dark matter scenarios. In this paper, we\npresent an assessment procedure of dark matter scenarios. First, we use Gaia's\ndata to infer the single-body phase-space density of the stars in the Fornax\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy. The latter, together with the Jeans equation, after\neliminating the gravitational potential using the Poisson equation, reveals the\nmass density of dark matter as a function of its position in the galaxy. We\nderive the correlations between dark matter mass densities as a function of\ndistances between them. No statistically significant correlation is observed.\nSecond, for the sake of comparison with the standard cold dark matter, we also\ncompute the correlations between dark matter mass densities in a small halo of\nthe Eagle hydrodynamics simulation. We show that the correlations from the\nsimulation and from Gaia are in agreement. Third, we show that Gaia\nobservations can be used to limit the parameter space of the Ginzburg--Landau\nstatistical field theory of dark matter mass densities and subsequently shrink\nthe parameter space of any dark matter model.

We investigate the\ncorrelations between $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ and $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$,\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent width ($W_{\\lambda}({\\rm Ly\\alpha})$), peak separation\n($v_{\\rm sep}$), central escape fraction ($f_{\\rm cen}$), and red peak\nasymmetry ($A_f^{\\rm red}$). We find that $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ and\n$f_{\\rm cen}$ are good diagnostics for LyC leakage, selecting for galaxies with\nlower neutral gas densities and less UV attenuation that have recently\nexperienced supernova feedback. In contrast, $W_{\\lambda}({\\rm Ly\\alpha})$ and\n$v_{\\rm sep}$ are found to be necessary but insufficient diagnostics, while\n$A_f^{\\rm red}$ carries little information. Finally, we use stacks of\nLy$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$, and F150W mock surface brightness profiles to find that\ngalaxies with high $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ have less extended Ly$\\alpha$ and\nF150W but larger H$\\alpha$ haloes than their non-leaking counterparts. This\nconfirms that Ly$\\alpha$ spectral profiles and surface brightness morphology\ncan be used to better understand the escape of LyC photons from galaxies during\nthe Epoch of Reionization.",

We then compute the angular momenta of the stars and develop a\nmodel to characterise the phase spiral in terms of amplitude and rotation at\ndifferent locations in the disc.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN,\ndesigned to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited\nlabeled data.

This\nestablished dependence is expected to manifest itself on the clustering of the\ngalaxy population, a potential effect commonly known as galaxy assembly bias.\nUsing the IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation, we analyse the\ndependence of the properties and clustering of galaxies on the shape of the\nspecific mass accretion history of their hosting haloes (sMAH). We first show\nthat several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate with the slope of\nthe sMAH ($\\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper\n$\\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted\ngalaxies present larger stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster,\nreach the peak of their star formation histories at higher redshift, and become\nquenched earlier. We also demonstrate that $\\beta$ is more directly connected\nto these key galaxy formation properties than other broadly employed halo\nproxies, such as formation time. Finally, we measure the secondary dependence\nof galaxy clustering on $\\beta$ at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift.\nBy tracing back the evolution of individual haloes, we show that the amplitude\nof the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies\nincreases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of\n$M_\\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a\nfunction of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing\nsurveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong\nlensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities:\nthe stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, $\\alpha_{sps}$, defined as\nthe ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass\nobtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar\nmass and size.\n  Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards larger stellar masses,\nsmaller half-mass radii and larger dark matter masses. The amplitude of the\nbias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the\ngalaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens\nsample.

These PL and PW\nrelations were derived from a combined sample of five anomalous Cepheids in\nglobular cluster M92 and the Large Magellanic Cloud, both of which have\ndistance accurate to ~1% available from literature. Our g-band PL relation is\nsimilar to the B-band PL relation as reported in previous study. We applied our\nPL and PW relations to anomalous Cepheids discovered in dwarf galaxy Crater II,\nand found a larger but consistent distance modulus than the recent measurements\nbased on RR Lyrae. Our calibrations of gri-band PL and PW relations, even\nthough less precise due to small number of anomalous Cepheids, will be useful\nfor distance measurements to dwarf galaxies.",

          "abstract": "Type II Cepheids (T2C) are less frequently used counterparts of classical\nCepheids which provide the primary calibration of the distance ladder for\nmeasuring $H_0$ in the local Universe. In the era of the Hubble Tension, T2C\nvariables with the RR Lyrae stars (RRL) and the tip of the red giant branch\n(TRGB) can potentially provide classical Cepheid independent calibration of the\ncosmic distance ladder. Our goal is to provide an absolute calibration of the\nPeriod-Luminosity, Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Wesenheit\nrelations(PL,PLC and PW) of T2Cs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We\nexploited time-series photometry in the near-infrared (NIR) bands for a sample\nof more than 320 T2Cs in the Magellanic Clouds (MC). These observations were\nacquired during 2009-2018 in the context of the VMC ESO public survey (The\nVISTA near-infrared YJKs survey of the Magellanic System). The NIR photometry\nwas supplemented with well-sampled optical light curves and accurate pulsation\nperiods from the OGLE IV survey and the Gaia mission. We used the best-quality\nNIR light curves to generate custom templates for modelling sparsely sampled\nlight curves in YJKs bands; in turn, we derived accurate and precise\nintensity-averaged mean magnitudes and pulsation amplitudes of 339 T2Cs in the\nMC. We used optical and NIR mean magnitudes to derive PL/PLC/PW relations for\nT2Cs in multiple bands, which were calibrated with the geometric distance to\nthe LMC and with the Gaia parallaxes. We used our new empirical calibrations of\nPL/PW relations to obtain distances to 22 T2C-host Galactic globular clusters,\nwhich were found to be systematically smaller by 0.1 mag and 0.03-0.06 mag\ncompared with the literature. A better agreement is found between our distances\nand those based on RRLs in globular clusters, providing strong support for\nusing these population II stars with the TRGB for future distance scale\nstudies.",

While\nthe bulk of our UDGs have GC abundances consistent with normal dwarf galaxies,\ntwo of these UDGs have excess GC populations. These two UDGs both have GC\nluminosity functions consistent with higher surface brightness galaxies and\ncluster UDGs. We then combine our nine objects with previous studies to create\na catalog of UDGs with analyzed GC populations that spans a uniquely diverse\nrange of environments. We use this catalog to examine broader trends in the GC\npopulations of low stellar mass galaxies. The highest GC abundances are found\nin cluster UDGs, but whether cluster UDGs are actually more extreme requires\nstudy of many more UDGs in groups. We find a possible positive correlation\nbetween GC abundance and stellar mass, and between GC abundance and galaxy size\nat fixed stellar mass. However, we see no significant stellar-mass galaxy-size\nrelation, over our limited stellar mass range. We consider possible origins of\nthe correlation between GC abundance and galaxy size, including the possibility\nthat these two galaxy properties are both dependent on the galaxy dark matter\nhalo, or that they are related through baryonic processes like internal\nfeedback.",

          "abstract": "We examine ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and their relation to non-UDGs in\nmass-radius-luminosity space. We begin by publishing Keck/KCWI spectroscopy for\nthe Coma cluster UDG Y358, for which we measure both a recessional velocity and\nvelocity dispersion. Our recessional velocity confirms association with the\nComa cluster and Y358's status as a UDG. From our velocity dispersion (19 $\\pm$\n3 km s$^{-1}$) we calculate a dynamical mass within the half-light radius which\nprovides evidence for a core in Y358's dark matter halo. We compare this\ndynamical mass, along with those for globular cluster (GC)-rich/-poor UDGs in\nthe literature, to mass profiles for isolated, gas-rich UDGs and UDGs in the\nNIHAO/FIRE simulations. We find GC-poor UDGs have dynamical masses similar to\nisolated, gas-rich UDGs, suggesting an evolutionary pathway may exist between\nthe two. Conversely, GC-rich UDGs have dynamical masses too massive to be\neasily explained as the evolution of the isolated, gas-rich UDGs. The simulated\nUDGs match the dynamical masses of the GC-rich UDGs. However, once compared in\nstellar mass -- halo mass space, the FIRE/NIHAO simulated UDGs do not match the\nhalo masses of either the isolated, gas-rich UDGs or the GC-rich UDGs at the\nsame stellar mass. Finally, we supplement our data for Y358 with other UDGs\nthat have measured velocity dispersions in the literature. We compare this\nsample to a wide range of non-UDGs in mass-radius-luminosity space, finding\nUDGs have a similar locus to non-UDGs of similar luminosity with the primary\ndifference being their larger half-light radii.",

          "abstract": "Ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reveal extreme properties. Here we compile the\nlargest study to date of 85 globular cluster (GC) systems around UDGs in the\nComa cluster, using new deep ground-based imaging of the known UDGs and\nexisting imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope of their GC systems. We find\nthat the richness of GC systems in UDGs generally exceeds that found in normal\ndwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass. These GC-rich UDGs imply halos more\nmassive than expected from the standard stellar mass-halo mass relation. The\npresence of such overly massive halos presents a significant challenge to the\nlatest simulations of UDGs in cluster environments. In some exceptional cases,\nthe mass in the GC system is a significant fraction of the stellar content of\nthe host galaxy. We find that rich GC systems tend to be hosted in UDGs of\nlower luminosity, smaller size and fainter surface brightness. Similar trends\nare seen for normal dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster. A toy model is\npresented in which the GC-rich UDGs are assumed to be `failed' galaxies within\nmassive halos that have largely old, metal-poor, alpha-element enhanced stellar\npopulations. On the other hand, GC-poor UDGs are more akin to normal, low\nsurface brightness dwarfs that occupy less massive dark matter halos.\nAdditional data on the stellar populations of UDGs with GC systems will help to\nfurther refine and test this simplistic model.",

Assuming these ions\nform in the cool ($T\\approx10^4$ K) CGM with photoionization equilibrium, the\nobserved H I and metal column density profiles can be best explained by an\nempirical model with low gas density and high volume filling factor.
