In a neighborhood of null infinity, in an appropriate\ncompactification of the spacetime to a manifold with corners, the wave\noperators are of edge type at null infinity and totally characteristic at\nspacelike and future timelike infinity. On a corresponding scale of Sobolev\nspaces, we demonstrate how microlocal regularity propagates across or into null\ninfinity via a sequence of radial sets. As an application, inspired by work of\nthe second author with Baskin and Wunsch, we prove regularity and decay\nestimates for forward solutions of wave type equations on asymptotically flat\nspacetimes which are asymptotically homogeneous with respect to scaling in the\nforward timelike cone and have an appropriate structure at null infinity.

Instead, we can train such networks\nfrom additional information obtained by employing the physical laws and\nevaluating them at random points in the space-time domain. Such\nphysics-informed machine learning integrates multimodality and multifidelity\ndata with mathematical models, and implements them using neural networks or\ngraph networks. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding\nphysics into machine learning, using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)\nbased primarily on feed-forward neural networks and automatic differentiation.\nFor more complex systems or systems of systems and unstructured data, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) present some distinct advantages, and here we review how\nphysics-informed learning can be accomplished with GNNs based on graph exterior\ncalculus to construct differential operators; we refer to these architectures\nas physics-informed graph networks (PIGNs). We present representative examples\nfor both forward and inverse problems and discuss what advances are needed to\nscale up PINNs, PIGNs and more broadly GNNs for large-scale engineering\nproblems.",
