The five sections of these notes\ncorrespond to the five lectures, but more details have been added.\n  $2$-dimensional topological field theories ($2$D TFTs) valued in vector\nspaces are commutative Frobenius algebras. The goal of this lecture series is\nto generalize from the $1$-category of vector spaces to any symmetric monoidal\n$\\infty$-category $\\mathcal{C}$, i.e. to study symmetric monoidal functors\n$\\mathrm{Bord}_2 \\to \\mathcal{C}$. Choosing $\\mathcal{C}$ to be the\n$(2,1)$-category of linear categories, this recovers a definition of modular\nfunctors, and choosing it to be the derived category of a ring yields a notion\nclosely related to cohomological field theories. We will introduce a notion of\nmodular $\\infty$-operads and algebras over them, construct the modular\n$\\infty$-operad of surfaces $\\mathcal{M}$, and show that algebras over\n$\\mathcal{M}$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ are exactly $2$D TFTs valued in $\\mathcal{C}$.\nAlong the way we will encounter variants modular $\\infty$-operads (such as\ncyclic $\\infty$-operads and $\\infty$-properads) as well as a proof of the $1$D\ncobordism hypothesis with singularities. This uses some (mild)\n$\\infty$-category theory, but no familiarity with ($\\infty$-)operads will be\nassumed. The main goal will be to filter $\\mathcal{M}$ by genus to obtain an\nobstruction-theoretic description of $2$D TFTs with general target. Applying\nthis to invertible TFTs one can construct a new spectral sequence exhibiting\nrelations between the cohomology groups of moduli spaces of curves.",

          "year": "2023-06",
          "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is an area of data science that focuses on\nusing invariants from algebraic topology to provide multiscale shape\ndescriptors for geometric data sets such as point clouds. One of the most\nimportant such descriptors is {\\em persistent homology}, which encodes the\nchange in shape as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the\nfeature scale. For many data sets, it is useful to simultaneously vary multiple\nfiltration parameters, for example feature scale and density. While the\ntheoretical properties of single parameter persistent homology are well\nunderstood, less is known about the multiparameter case. In particular, a\ncentral question is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent\nhomology by elements of a vector space for integration with standard machine\nlearning algorithms. Existing approaches to this problem either ignore most of\nthe multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are\nheuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise. In this article, we\nintroduce a new general representation framework that leverages recent results\non {\\em decompositions} of multiparameter persistent homology. This framework\nis rich in information, fast to compute, and encompasses previous approaches.\nMoreover, we establish theoretical stability guarantees under this framework as\nwell as efficient algorithms for practical computation, making this framework\nan applicable and versatile tool for analyzing geometric and point cloud data.\nWe validate our stability results and algorithms with numerical experiments\nthat demonstrate statistical convergence, prediction accuracy, and fast running\ntimes on several real data sets.",

These summaries are\nuseful for computational purposes, but they are merely a marginal of the actual\ntopological information that persistent homology can provide. Instead, our\napproach compares between two topological representations directly in the data\nspace. We do so by defining a correspondence relation between individual\npersistent cycles of two different spaces, and devising a method for computing\nthis correspondence. Our matching of cycles is based on both the persistence\nintervals and the spatial placement of each feature. We demonstrate our new\nframework in the context of topological inference, where we use statistical\nbootstrap methods in order to differentiate between real features and noise in\npoint cloud data.",

The required background theory and a method of computing persistent\nhomology is presented here, with applications specific to structural health\nmonitoring. These results allow for topological inference and the ability to\ndeduce features in higher-dimensional data, that might otherwise be overlooked.\n  A simplicial complex is constructed for data for a given distance parameter.\nThis complex encodes information about the local proximity of data points. A\nsingular homology value can be calculated from this simplicial complex.\nExtending this idea, the distance parameter is given for a range of values, and\nthe homology is calculated over this range. The persistent homology is a\nrepresentation of how the homological features of the data persist over this\ninterval. The result is characteristic to the data.
