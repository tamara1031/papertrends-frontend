This structure is determined by the\nlaser-induced electron displacement [Geng L et al. 2021 Phys. Rev. A 104(2)\nL021102]. In the present work, we find that the Fresnel diffraction picture is\nalso present in the tunneling and over-barrier regime of ionization by short\npulses. However, the electron displacement is now induced by the electric field\ncomponent of the laser pulse, instead of by the magnetic field component in the\ncase of the superintense XUV pulse. After corresponding modifications to our\nquantum and semiclassical models, we find the same physical mechanism of the\nFresnel diffraction governs the low-energy interference structures along the\nlaser polarization. The results predicted by the two models agree well with the\naccurate results from the numerical solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger\nequation.",

Here we report a very pronounced\nand narrow (25 mG) Feshbach resonance in collisions between two ground state\nNaLi molecules. This molecular Feshbach resonance has two special\ncharacteristics. First, the collisional loss rate is enhanced by more than two\norders of magnitude above the background loss rate which is saturated at the\n$p$-wave universal value, due to strong chemical reactivity. Second, the\nresonance is located at a magnetic field where two open channels become nearly\ndegenerate. This implies the intermediate complex predominantly decays to the\nsecond open channel.

While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this\nphenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle distance\nis below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a\nrealistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like)\natoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new\nopportunities for light-matter interactions as their internal structure allows\nfor trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength\ntransitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative\ninteractions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that\ntwo-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body\nsuperradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance\neffectively ``closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more\ntwo-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the\nemission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the\nsingle-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching.\nOur work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as\nquantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative\ndynamics.",

          "abstract": "In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled\ntogether to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over\nthe past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as\nmore precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and\nquantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity\nQED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative\nphenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nphase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative\nresonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven\nemitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite\ntremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental\nsystem. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase\ntransition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr\natoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical\ntransition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state\ndetermined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation.\nThe steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a\nsuperradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo\npersistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In\nfact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase\ntransition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous\nemission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our\nobservations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative\nsystems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be\nharnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.",

We experimentally investigate this effect\nfor a chiral, i.e.,~direction-dependent light--matter coupling. Despite a\nfundamentally different interaction Hamiltonian which has a reduced symmetry\ncompared to the standard Dicke case, we do observe a superradiant burst\nemission. The burst occurs above a threshold number of atoms, and its peak\npower scales faster with the number of atoms than in the case of free-space\nDicke superradiance. We measure the first-order coherence of the burst emission\nand experimentally distinguish two regimes, one dominated by the coherence\ninduced during the excitation process and the other governed by vacuum\nfluctuations. Our results shed light on the collective radiative dynamics of\ncascaded quantum many-body systems, i.e., a system in which each quantum\nemitter is only driven by light radiated by emitters that are further upstream\nin the cascade.

This approach enables the measurement of\nany vector component of the Earth's magnetic field with the same sensitivity.\nThe OPM is realized by a microfabricated cesium vapor cell with nitrogen buffer\ngas, which is immersed into a homogeneous bias field of about 730 $\\mathrm{\\mu\nT}$. Since this bias field is about one order of magnitude stronger than\nEarth's magnetic field, it defines the sensitive axis of the OPM. The bias\nfield is generated by solid-state magnets and was designed to exhibit a very\nlow relative inhomogeneity ($< 10^{-4}$ in relative units) within the vapor\ncell dimensions as well as a point of vanishing temperature dependence at\naround 40{\\deg}C.

Using a single laser beam containing equal strength of linear-\nand circular-polarization components and amplitude-modulation at a low-duty\ncycle, we have synchronously pumped the rubidium-87 atoms with both first- and\nsecond-order frequency harmonics. Such a pumping scheme has enabled us to\nobserve the free Larmor precession of atomic spins at a frequency of $\\Omega_L$\n(orientation) and/or 2$\\Omega_L$ (alignment) in a single FID signal, depending\non the direction of the external magnetic field. We observed that the amplitude\nof the FID signal does not go to zero for any magnetic field direction, proving\nthe absence of dead zones in the magnetometer.
