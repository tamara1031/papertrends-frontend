          "abstract": "Social media has become an important venue for diverse groups to share\ninformation, discuss political issues, and organize social movements. Recent\nscholarship has shown that the social media ecosystem can affect political\nthinking and expression. Individuals and groups across the political spectrum\nhave engaged in the use of these platforms extensively, even creating their own\nforums with varying approaches to content moderation in pursuit of freer\nstandards of speech. The Gab social media platform arose in this context. Gab\nis a social media platform for the so-called alt right, and much of the popular\npress has opined about the thematic content of discourses on Gab and platforms\nlike it, but little research has examined the content itself. Using a publicly\navailable dataset of all Gab posts from August 2016 until July 2019, the\ncurrent paper explores a five percent random sample of this dataset to explore\nthematic content on the platform. We run multiple structural topic models,\nusing standard procedures to arrive at an optimal k number of topics. The final\nmodel specifies 85 topics for 403,469 documents. We include as prevalence\nvariables whether the source account has been flagged as a bot and the number\nof followers for the source account. Results suggest the most nodal topics in\nthe dataset pertain to the authenticity of the Holocaust, the meaning of red\npill, and the journalistic merit of mainstream media. We conclude by discussing\nthe implications of our findings for work in ethical content moderation, online\ncommunity development, political polarization, and avenues for future research.",

The latter, referred to as political polarization, is\nof growing societal concern across the world. Here we map and quantify\nlinguistic divergence across the partisan left-right divide in the United\nStates, using social media data. We develop a general methodology to delineate\n(social) media users by their political preference, based on which (potentially\nbiased) news media accounts they do and do not follow on a given platform. Our\ndata consists of 1.5M short posts by 10k users (about 20M words) from the\nsocial media platform Twitter (now \"X\"). Delineating this sample involved\nmining the platform for the lists of followers (n=422M) of 72 large news media\naccounts. We quantify divergence in topics of conversation and word\nfrequencies, messaging sentiment, and lexical semantics of words and emoji. We\nfind signs of linguistic divergence across all these aspects, especially in\ntopics and themes of conversation, in line with previous research. While US\nAmerican English remains largely intelligible within its large speech\ncommunity, our findings point at areas where miscommunication may eventually\narise given ongoing polarization and therefore potential linguistic divergence.\nOur methodology - combining data mining, lexicostatistics, machine learning,\nlarge language models and a systematic human annotation approach - is largely\nlanguage and platform agnostic. In other words, while we focus here on US\npolitical divides and US English, the same approach is applicable to other\ncountries, languages, and social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on\nonline social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly\nstem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise\nin social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research\npractice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for\na given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on\nsocial media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization\nat the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such\nexisting analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires\nlaborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks\nthe ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media\nconversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in\nsocial media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user\ncommunities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we\nfirst introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post\ncontent to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality\nof heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated\ndataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can\nexhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social\nmedia posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot\nlearning setups.

Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies\nand computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating\nhigh-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly\nimproving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk\nassessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides\na comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed\nepidemic modeling.

          "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning from\ngraph-based data. The key mechanism of current GNNs is message passing, where a\nnode's feature is updated based on the information passing from its local\nneighbourhood. A limitation of this mechanism is that node features become\nincreasingly dominated by the information aggregated from the neighbourhood as\nwe use more rounds of message passing. Consequently, as the GNN layers become\ndeeper, adjacent node features tends to be similar, making it more difficult\nfor GNNs to distinguish adjacent nodes, thereby, limiting the performance of\nGNNs. In this paper, we propose conditional local feature encoding (CLFE) to\nhelp prevent the problem of node features being dominated by the information\nfrom local neighbourhood. The idea of our method is to extract the node hidden\nstate embedding from message passing process and concatenate it with the nodes\nfeature from previous stage, then we utilise linear transformation to form a\nCLFE based on the concatenated vector. The CLFE will form the layer output to\nbetter preserve node-specific information, thus help to improve the performance\nof GNN models.

          "abstract": "In this era of fast and large-scale opinion formation, a mathematical\nunderstanding of opinion evolution, a.k.a. opinion dynamics, is especially\nimportant. Linear graph-based dynamics and bounded confidence dynamics are the\ntwo most popular models for opinion dynamics in social networks. Recently,\nstochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics were proposed as a general\nframework that incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also\ncaptures the inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social\nexchanges. Although these dynamics are quite general and realistic, their\nanalysis is particularly challenging compared to other opinion dynamics models.\nThis is because these dynamics are nonlinear and stochastic, and belong to the\nclass of Markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift and unbounded\njumps. The asymptotic behavior of these dynamics was characterized in prior\nworks. However, they do not shed light on their finite-time behavior, which is\noften of interest in practice. We take a stride in this direction by analyzing\nthe finite time behavior of a two-agent system, which is fundamental to the\nunderstanding of multi-agent dynamics. In particular, we show that the opinion\ndifference between the two agents is well concentrated around zero under the\nconditions that lead to asymptotic stability of the dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The dissemination of fake news significantly affects personal reputation and\npublic trust. Recently, fake news detection has attracted tremendous attention,\nand previous studies mainly focused on finding clues from news content or\ndiffusion path. However, the required features of previous models are often\nunavailable or insufficient in early detection scenarios, resulting in poor\nperformance. Thus, early fake news detection remains a tough challenge.\nIntuitively, the news from trusted and authoritative sources or shared by many\nusers with a good reputation is more reliable than other news. Using the\ncredibility of publishers and users as prior weakly supervised information, we\ncan quickly locate fake news in massive news and detect them in the early\nstages of dissemination.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-aware Multi-head Attention\nNetwork (SMAN), which combines the news content, publishing, and reposting\nrelations of publishers and users, to jointly optimize the fake news detection\nand credibility prediction tasks. In this way, we can explicitly exploit the\ncredibility of publishers and users for early fake news detection. We conducted\nexperiments on three real-world datasets, and the results show that SMAN can\ndetect fake news in 4 hours with an accuracy of over 91%, which is much faster\nthan the state-of-the-art models.",

The susceptibility to fake news attacks hinges\non whether Internet users perceive a fake news article/snippet to be legitimate\nafter reading it. In this paper, we attempt to garner an in-depth understanding\nof users' susceptibility to text-centric fake news attacks via a\nneuro-cognitive methodology. We investigate the neural underpinnings relevant\nto fake/real news through EEG. We run an experiment with human users to pursue\na thorough investigation of users' perception and cognitive processing of\nfake/real news. We analyze the neural activity associated with the fake/real\nnews detection task for different categories of news articles. Our results show\nthere may be no statistically significant or automatically inferable\ndifferences in the way the human brain processes the fake vs. real news, while\nmarked differences are observed when people are subject to (real/fake) news vs.\nresting state and even between some different categories of fake news. This\nneuro-cognitive finding may help to justify users' susceptibility to fake news\nattacks, as also confirmed from the behavioral analysis. In other words, the\nfake news articles may seem almost indistinguishable from the real news\narticles in both behavioral and neural domains.

However, social\nnetworks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models,\nresulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail\nitems, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is\nessentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social\nrecommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the\nredundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social\ninfluence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments.\nIn this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named\nCGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social\nnetwork and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More\nspecifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model\n(CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing\nusers' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates\nusers' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the\nweights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity\nbias present in the recommendation model.

Addressing this problem is crucial, and existing methods often\nrely on techniques such as weight adjustment or leveraging unbiased data to\neliminate this bias. However, we argue that not all biases are detrimental,\ni.e., some items recommended by friends may align with the user's interests.\nBlindly eliminating such biases could undermine these positive effects,\npotentially diminishing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nCausal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in\nsocial recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance. From\nthe perspective of causal inference, we find that the user social network could\nbe regarded as a confounder between the user and item embeddings (treatment)\nand ratings (outcome). Due to the presence of this social network confounder,\ntwo paths exist from user and item embeddings to ratings: a non-causal social\ninfluence path and a causal interest path. Building upon this insight, we\npropose a disentangled encoder that focuses on disentangling user and item\nembeddings into interest and social influence embeddings. Mutual\ninformation-based objectives are designed to enhance the distinctiveness of\nthese disentangled embeddings, eliminating redundant information. Additionally,\na regulatory decoder that employs a weight calculation module to dynamically\nlearn the weights of social influence embeddings for effectively regulating\nsocial influence bias has been designed.

Early\napproaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors'\ninterests for better user modeling and failed to model the social influence\ndiffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we\npropose a preliminary work of a neural influence diffusion network (i.e.,\nDiffNet) for social recommendation (Diffnet), which models the recursive social\ndiffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user.\nHowever, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social\nnetwork and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion\nprocess in the social network would neglect the users' latent collaborative\ninterests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose\nDiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence\ndiffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the\nsocial recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest\nnetwork as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting these two network\ninformation for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by\niteratively aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's\nprevious embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the\nsocial network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the\nuser-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention\nnetwork that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these\nthree aspects.

Most notably, the scalability of our algorithm is well illustrated by\nits successful application to large graphs with up to over a billion temporal\nedges and over a hundred million nodes.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a general framework for leveraging graph stream data for\ntemporal prediction-based applications. Our proposed framework includes novel\nmethods for learning an appropriate graph time-series representation, modeling\nand weighting the temporal dependencies, and generalizing existing embedding\nmethods for such data. While previous work on dynamic modeling and embedding\nhas focused on representing a stream of timestamped edges using a time-series\nof graphs based on a specific time-scale (e.g., 1 month), we propose the notion\nof an $\\epsilon$-graph time-series that uses a fixed number of edges for each\ngraph, and show its superiority over the time-scale representation used in\nprevious work. In addition, we propose a number of new temporal models based on\nthe notion of temporal reachability graphs and weighted temporal summary\ngraphs. These temporal models are then used to generalize existing base\n(static) embedding methods by enabling them to incorporate and appropriately\nmodel temporal dependencies in the data. From the 6 temporal network models\ninvestigated (for each of the 7 base embedding methods), we find that the top-3\ntemporal models are always those that leverage the new $\\epsilon$-graph\ntime-series representation. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods from the\nframework almost always achieve better predictive performance than existing\nstate-of-the-art dynamic node embedding methods that are developed specifically\nfor such temporal prediction tasks. Finally, the findings of this work are\nuseful for designing better dynamic embedding methods.",

This paper\npresents a novel approach to developing a Bitcoin transaction forecast model,\nDLForecast, by leveraging deep neural networks for learning Bitcoin transaction\nnetwork representations. DLForecast makes three original contributions. First,\nwe explore three interesting properties between Bitcoin transaction accounts:\ntopological connectivity pattern of Bitcoin accounts, transaction amount\npattern, and transaction dynamics. Second, we construct a time-decaying\nreachability graph and a time-decaying transaction pattern graph, aiming at\ncapturing different types of spatial-temporal Bitcoin transaction patterns.\nThird, we employ node embedding on both graphs and develop a Bitcoin\ntransaction forecasting system between user accounts based on historical\ntransactions with built-in time-decaying factor. To maintain an effective\ntransaction forecasting performance, we leverage the multiplicative model\nupdate (MMU) ensemble to combine prediction models built on different\ntransaction features extracted from each corresponding Bitcoin transaction\ngraph. Evaluated on real-world Bitcoin transaction data, we show that our\nspatial-temporal forecasting model is efficient with fast runtime and effective\nwith forecasting accuracy over 60\\% and improves the prediction performance by\n50\\% when compared to forecasting model built on the static graph baseline.",

          "abstract": "With the overall momentum of the blockchain industry, crypto-based crimes are\nbecoming more and more prevalent. After committing a crime, the main goal of\ncybercriminals is to obfuscate the source of the illicit funds in order to\nconvert them into cash and get away with it. Many studies have analyzed money\nlaundering in the field of the traditional financial sector and\nblockchain-based Bitcoin. But so far, little is known about the characteristics\nof crypto money laundering in the blockchain-based Web3 ecosystem. To fill this\ngap, and considering that Ethereum is the largest platform on Web3, in this\npaper, we systematically study the behavioral characteristics and economic\nimpact of money laundering accounts through the lenses of Ethereum heists.\nBased on a very small number of tagged accounts of exchange hackers, DeFi\nexploiters, and scammers, we mine untagged money laundering groups through\nheuristic transaction tracking methods, to carve out a full picture of security\nincidents. By analyzing account characteristics and transaction networks, we\nobtain many interesting findings about crypto money laundering in Web3,\nobserving the escalating money laundering methods such as creating counterfeit\ntokens and masquerading as speculators. Finally, based on these findings we\nprovide inspiration for anti-money laundering to promote the healthy\ndevelopment of the Web3 ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The decentralization, redundancy, and pseudo-anonymity features have made\npermission-less public blockchain platforms attractive for adoption as\ntechnology platforms for cryptocurrencies. However, such adoption has enabled\ncybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in blockchain platforms and target\nthe users through social engineering to carry out malicious activities. Most of\nthe state-of-the-art techniques for detecting malicious actors depend on the\ntransactional behavior of individual wallet addresses but do not analyze the\nmoney trails. We propose a heuristics-based approach that adds new features\nassociated with money trails to analyze and find suspicious activities in\ncryptocurrency blockchains. Here, we focus only on the cyclic behavior and\nidentify hidden patterns present in the temporal transactions graphs in a\nblockchain. We demonstrate our methods on the transaction data of the Ethereum\nblockchain. We find that malicious activities (such as Gambling, Phishing, and\nMoney Laundering) have different cyclic patterns in Ethereum. We also identify\ntwo suspicious temporal cyclic path-based transfers in Ethereum. Our techniques\nmay apply to other cryptocurrency blockchains with appropriate modifications\nadapted to the nature of the crypto-currency under investigation.",

          "abstract": "To measure node importance, network scientists employ centrality scores that\ntypically take a microscopic or macroscopic perspective, relying on node\nfeatures or global network structure. However, traditional centrality measures\nsuch as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or PageRank neglect the\ncommunity structure found in real-world networks. To study node importance\nbased on network flows from a mesoscopic perspective, we analytically derive a\ncommunity-aware information-theoretic centrality score based on network flow\nand the coding principles behind the map equation: map equation centrality. Map\nequation centrality measures how much further we can compress the network's\nmodular description by not coding for random walker transitions to the\nrespective node, using an adapted coding scheme and determining node importance\nfrom a network flow-based point of view. The information-theoretic centrality\nmeasure can be determined from a node's local network context alone because\nchanges to the coding scheme only affect other nodes in the same module. Map\nequation centrality is agnostic to the chosen network flow model and allows\nresearchers to select the model that best reflects the dynamics of the process\nunder study. Applied to synthetic networks, we highlight how our approach\nenables a more fine-grained differentiation between nodes than node-local or\nnetwork-global measures. Predicting influential nodes for two different\ndynamical processes on real-world networks with traditional and other\ncommunity-aware centrality measures, we find that activating nodes based on map\nequation centrality scores tends to create the largest cascades in a linear\nthreshold model.",

          "year": "2024-04",
          "abstract": "The debate around vaccines has been going on for decades, but the COVID-19\npandemic showed how crucial it is to understand and mitigate anti-vaccine\nsentiments. While the pandemic may be over, it is still important to understand\nhow the pandemic affected the anti-vaccine discourse, and whether the arguments\nagainst non-COVID vaccines (e.g., Flu, MMR, IPV, HPV vaccines) have also\nchanged due to the pandemic. This study attempts to answer these questions\nthrough a large-scale study of anti-vaccine posts on Twitter. Almost all prior\nworks that utilized social media to understand anti-vaccine opinions considered\nonly the three broad stances of Anti-Vax, Pro-Vax, and Neutral. There has not\nbeen any effort to identify the specific reasons/concerns behind the anti-vax\nsentiments (e.g., side-effects, conspiracy theories, political reasons) on\nsocial media at scale. In this work, we propose two novel methods for\nclassifying tweets into 11 different anti-vax concerns -- a discriminative\napproach (entailment-based) and a generative approach (based on instruction\ntuning of LLMs) -- which outperform several strong baselines. We then apply\nthis classifier on anti-vaccine tweets posted over a 5-year period (Jan 2018 -\nJan 2023) to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the anti-vaccine\nconcerns among the masses. We find that the pandemic has made the anti-vaccine\ndiscourse far more complex than in the pre-COVID times, and increased the\nvariety of concerns being voiced. Alarmingly, we find that concerns about COVID\nvaccines are now being projected onto the non-COVID vaccines, thus making more\npeople hesitant in taking vaccines in the post-COVID era.",

However, when vaccines\nstarted arriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine\nhesitancy might be an issue even in the context of this major epidemic. Does it\nmean that the mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one\nof the main causes of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this\npaper, we wish to contribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the\nCOVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause\nreticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to\ninfluence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates\nover the COVID-19 vaccine on the French Twittosphere, during two first years of\nthe pandemic, with a particular attention to the spreading capacity of\nvaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did\nvaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the\ncentral actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debates over vaccines\nexperienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share of\nvaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited\nnumber of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing\nthe community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the\nmesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing\nthe major communities of users. We analyze their role in the information\necosystem: the largest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior\ncollecting all the vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it\ninside the community. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to\nvaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.",

During the pandemic,\nanti-science and political misinformation/conspiracies have been rampant on\nsocial media. Therefore, we investigate misinformation and conspiracy groups\nand their characteristic behaviours in Twitter data collected on COVID-19\nvaccines. We identify if any suspicious coordinated efforts are present in\npromoting vaccine misinformation, and find two suspicious groups - one\npromoting a 'Great Reset' conspiracy which suggests that the pandemic is\norchestrated by world leaders to take control of the economy, with vaccine\nrelated misinformation and strong anti-vaccine and anti-social messages such as\nno lock-downs; and another promoting the Bioweapon theory. Misinformation\npromoted is largely from the anti-vaccine and far-right communities in the\n3-core of the retweet graph, with its tweets proportion of conspiracy and\nquestionable sources to reliable sources being much higher. In comparison with\nthe mainstream and health news, the right-leaning community is more influenced\nby the anti-vaccine and far-right communities, which is also reflected in the\ndisparate vaccination rates in left and right U.S. states.
