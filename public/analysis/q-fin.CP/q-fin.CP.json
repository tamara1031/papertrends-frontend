We use\nneural networks as function approximators for the drift and diffusion of the\nmodelled SDE system, and impose constraints on the neural nets such that\nno-arbitrage conditions are preserved.

          "abstract": "This article presents XGB-Chiarella, a powerful new approach for deploying\nagent-based models to generate realistic intra-day artificial financial price\ndata. This approach is based on agent-based models, calibrated by XGBoost\nmachine learning surrogate. Following the Extended Chiarella model, three types\nof trading agents are introduced in this agent-based model: fundamental\ntraders, momentum traders, and noise traders. In particular, XGB-Chiarella\nfocuses on configuring the simulation to accurately reflect real market\nbehaviours. Instead of using the original Expectation-Maximisation algorithm\nfor parameter estimation, the agent-based Extended Chiarella model is\ncalibrated using XGBoost machine learning surrogate. It is shown that the\nmachine learning surrogate learned in the proposed method is an accurate proxy\nof the true agent-based market simulation. The proposed calibration method is\nsuperior to the original Expectation-Maximisation parameter estimation in terms\nof the distance between historical and simulated stylised facts. With the same\nunderlying model, the proposed methodology is capable of generating realistic\nprice time series in various stocks listed at three different exchanges, which\nindicates the universality of intra-day price formation process. For the time\nscale (minutes) chosen in this paper, one agent per category is shown to be\nsufficient to capture the intra-day price formation process. The proposed\nXGB-Chiarella approach provides insights that the price formation process is\ncomprised of the interactions between momentum traders, fundamental traders,\nand noise traders. It can also be used to enhance risk management by\npractitioners.",

          "abstract": "Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade\nthe price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices,\naiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional\nhedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero\ntransaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and\nuncertain real-world markets.\n  With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading\nstrategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a\nderivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement\nlearning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a\nhedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and\nhedging.\n  Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic\nfinancial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of\nderivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses\nhigh-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing\nnonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies\nwithin this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and\nconstructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.\n  Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop\na risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging\nas a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior\ncloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This\npretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's\nperformance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets\ndemonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.",

          "abstract": "We introduce two quantum algorithms to compute the Value at Risk (VaR) and\nConditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of financial derivatives using quantum\ncomputers: the first by applying existing ideas from quantum risk analysis to\nderivative pricing, and the second based on a novel approach using Quantum\nSignal Processing (QSP). Previous work in the literature has shown that quantum\nadvantage is possible in the context of individual derivative pricing and that\nadvantage can be leveraged in a straightforward manner in the estimation of the\nVaR and CVaR. The algorithms we introduce in this work aim to provide an\nadditional advantage by encoding the derivative price over multiple market\nscenarios in superposition and computing the desired values by applying\nappropriate transformations to the quantum system. We perform complexity and\nerror analysis of both algorithms, and show that while the two algorithms have\nthe same asymptotic scaling the QSP-based approach requires significantly fewer\nquantum resources for the same target accuracy. Additionally, by numerically\nsimulating both quantum and classical VaR algorithms, we demonstrate that the\nquantum algorithm can extract additional advantage from a quantum computer\ncompared to individual derivative pricing. Specifically, we show that under\ncertain conditions VaR estimation can lower the latest published estimates of\nthe logical clock rate required for quantum advantage in derivative pricing by\nup to $\\sim 30$x. In light of these results, we are encouraged that our\nformulation of derivative pricing in the QSP framework may be further leveraged\nfor quantum advantage in other relevant financial applications, and that\nquantum computers could be harnessed more efficiently by considering problems\nin the financial sector at a higher level.",
