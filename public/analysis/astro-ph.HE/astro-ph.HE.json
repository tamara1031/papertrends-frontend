We aim to answer whether the source contains a\nstellar mass black hole with a super-Eddington accretion flow or an\nintermediate mass black hole accreting matter in a sub-Eddington mode.\nMoreover, we search for major observed changes in spectra and timing occur, and\ndetermine if they are associated with major structural changes in the disk,\nsimilar to those in black hole X-ray binaries. We performed timing and spectral\nanalysis to study the relation between luminosity and inner disk temperature.\nWe constructed the hardness ratio versus intensity diagram to reveal spectral\nstate transitions in Circinus ULX5. Our spectral analysis revealed at least\nthree distinctive spectral states of Circinus ULX5, in analogy to state\ntransitions in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. Disk-dominated spectra are\nfound in high flux states and the power-law dominated spectra are found in\nlower flux states. The source was also observed in an intermediate state, where\nthe flux was low, but spectrum is dominated by a disk component. Over eighteen\nyears of collected data, ULX5 appeared two times in the high, three times in\nthe low, and two times in the intermediate state. The fastest observed\ntransition was $\\sim$7 months. Our analysis suggests that the central object in\nCircinus ULX5 is a stellar mass BH ($<10\\ \\rm M_{\\odot}$), or possibly a NS\neven though we do not detect pulsations in the lightcurves. Fractional\nvariability amplitudes are consistent with state transitions in Circinus ULX5\nwherein higher variability from the power law-like Comptonized emission gets\nsuppressed in the thermal disk-dominated state.",

We present high-energy NuSTAR\nobservations of 9 Seyfert 2 AGN from the IRAS 12 micron survey, supplemented\nwith low-energy X-ray observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift. The\ngalaxies were selected to have anomalously low observed 2-10 keV luminosities\ncompared to their [O III] optical luminosities, a traditional diagnostic of\nheavily obscured AGN, reaching into the Compton-thick regime for the highest\nhydrogen column densities ($N_{\\rm H} > 1.5 \\times 10^{24}\\, {\\rm cm}^{-2}$).\nBased on updated [O III] luminosities and intrinsic X-ray luminosities based on\nphysical modeling of the hard X-ray spectra, we find that one galaxy was\nmisclassified as type 2 (NGC 5005) and most of the remaining AGN are obscured,\nincluding three confirmed as Compton-thick (IC 3639, NGC 1386, and NGC 3982).\nOne galaxy, NGC 3627, appears to be recently deactivated. Compared to the\noriginal sample the 9 AGN were selected from, this is a rate of approximately\n1%. We also find a new X-ray changing-look AGN in NGC 6890.",

The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of\n$\\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV X-ray band, which was $\\sim20$\ntimes more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray\nlightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Swift show a decline\nin flux from the source consistent with $t^{-5/3}$, and observations with\nNuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index\n$\\Gamma=2.9\\pm0.1$. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well known\nAGN properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events\n(TDE), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) can be described well by a disk blackbody model with\nan inner disk temperature of $7.3^{+0.3}_{-0.8}\\times10^{5}$ K, with a large\nfraction ($>40$%) of the disk emission up-scattered into the X-ray band.

Regardless of the mass scale, all of\nthese objects are expected to form binaries and eventually emit observable\ngravitational radiation, with more massive objects emitting at ever lower\ngravitational-wave frequencies. We present the tool, gwent, for modelling the\nsensitivities of current and future generations of gravitational wave detectors\nacross the entire gravitational-wave spectrum of coalescing black-hole\nbinaries. We provide methods to generate sensitivity curves for pulsar timing\narrays (PTAs) using a novel realistic PTA sensitivity curve generator,\nspace-based interferometers using adaptive models that can represent a wide\nrange of proposed detector designs, and ground-based interferometers using\nrealistic noise models that can reproduce current, second, and third generation\ndesigns, as well as novel variations of the essential design parameters. To\nmodel the signal from black-hole binaries at any mass scale, we use\nphenomenological waveforms capable of modelling the inspiral, merger, and\nringdown for sources with varying mass ratios and spins. Using this adaptable\nframework, we produce signal-to-noise ratios for the combination of any\nmodelled parameter, associated with either the detector or the source. By\nallowing variation across each detector and source parameter, we can pinpoint\nthe most important factors to determining the optimal performance for\nparticular instrument designs.

Such events have higher masses than are expected in isolated\nbinaries, component spin-tilt angles that are misaligned, and/or non-negligible\norbital eccentricities. We investigate the orbital eccentricities of 62 binary\nblack hole candidates from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue of\nthe LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration with an aligned-spin, moderate-eccentricity\nwaveform model. Within this framework, we find that at least four of these\nevents show significant support for eccentricity $e_{10} \\geq 0.1$ at a\ngravitational-wave frequency of $10$~Hz ($> 60\\%$ credibility, under a\nlog-uniform eccentricity prior that spans the range $10^{-4} < e_{10} < 0.2$).\nTwo of these events are new additions to the population: GW191109 and\nGW200208\\_22. If the four eccentric candidates are truly eccentric, our results\nsuggest that densely-populated star clusters may produce 100\\% of the observed\nmergers.

Waveform templates currently used in the matched-filter\ngravitational-wave searches of LIGO-Virgo data neglect effects of eccentricity\nwhich is expected to reduce their efficiency to detect eccentric binary black\nholes. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of coherent unmodeled gravitational-wave\nsearches (with minimal assumptions about the signal model) have been shown to\nbe largely unaffected by the presence of even sizable orbital eccentricity. In\nthis paper, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art search\nalgorithms recently used by LIGO and Virgo to search for binary black holes in\nthe second Observing Run (O2), quantifying their search sensitivity by\ninjecting numerical-relativity simulations of inspiral-merger-ringdown\neccentric waveforms into O2 LIGO data. Our results show that the matched-filter\nsearch PyCBC performs better than the unmodeled search cWB for the high chirp\nmass ($>20 M_{\\odot}$) and low eccentricity region ($e_{30 Hz} < 0.3$) of\nparameter space. For moderate eccentricities and low chirp mass, on the other\nhand, the unmodeled search is more sensitive than the modeled search.",

The\nabsence of FAST counterparts for the KM40M bursts suggests that individual\nbursts from FRB 20240114A are likely narrow-band, with fractional bandwidths\nless than 10%. By comparing the cumulative event rates from KM40M and FAST\nobservations, we found that the two measurements are compatible, indicating a\npossible flattening of the event rate at higher energies.

The evolution of SN 2021hpr is similar to that of SN 2011fe.\nIncluding SN 2021hpr, there have been six supernovae observed in the host\ngalaxy NGC 3147, and the supernovae explosion rate in the last 50 yr is\nslightly higher for SNe Ia, while lower for SNe Ibc and SNe II it is lower than\nexpected rate from the radio data. Inspecting the spectra, we find that SN\n2021hpr has a metal-rich (12 + log(O/H) $\\approx$ 8.648) circumstellar\nenvironment, where HV SNe tend to reside. Based on the decline rate of SN\n2021hpr in the $B$ band, we determine the distance modulus of the host galaxy\nNGC 3147 using the Phillips relation to be 33.46 $\\pm$ 0.21 mag, which is close\nto that found by previous works.",

One prime motivation is\nto understand the nonthermal particle acceleration at shocks. Although the\ntheory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) has long been the standard for\ncosmic-ray acceleration at shocks, plasma physical understanding of particle\nacceleration remains elusive. In this review, we discuss nonthermal electron\nacceleration mechanisms at quasi-perpendicular shocks, for which substantial\nprogress has been made in recent years. The discussion presented in this review\nis restricted to the following three specific topics. The first is stochastic\nshock drift acceleration (SSDA), which is a relatively new mechanism for\nelectron injection into DSA. The basic mechanism, related in-situ observations\nand kinetic simulations results, and how it is connected with DSA will be\ndiscussed. Second, we discuss shock surfing acceleration (SSA) at very high\nMach number shocks relevant to young supernova remnants (SNRs). While the\noriginal proposal under the one-dimensional assumption is unrealistic, SSA has\nnow been proven efficient by a fully three-dimensional kinetic simulation.\nFinally, we discuss the current understanding of the magnetized\nWeibel-dominated shock. Spontaneous magnetic reconnection of self-generated\ncurrent sheets within the shock structure is an interesting consequence of\nWeibel-generated strong magnetic turbulence. We argue that high Mach number\nshocks with both Alfven and sound Mach numbers exceeding 20-40 will likely\nbehave as a Weibel-dominated shock.

We initialize\nthe accretion disc with a magnetized torus by adopting the toroidal component\nof the magnetic vector potential. The initial magnetic field strength is set by\nusing the plasma beta parameter ($\\beta_0$). We observe self-consistent\nturbulence generated by magneto rotational instability (MRI) in the disc. The\nMRI turbulence transports angular momentum in the disc, resulting in an angular\nmomentum distribution that approaches a Keplerian distribution. We investigate\nthe effect of the magnetic field on the dynamics of the torus and associated\nmass outflow from the disc around a maximally spinning black hole $(a_k =\n0.99)$. For the purpose of our analysis, we investigate the magnetic state of\nour simulation model. The model $\\beta_0 = 10$ indicates the behaviour similar\nto the \"magnetically arrested disk (MAD)'' state, and all the other low\nmagnetic model remains in the SANE state. We observe that mass outflow rates\nare significantly enhanced with the increased magnetic field in the disc. We\nfind a positive correlation between the magnetic field and mass outflow rates.\nWe also investigate the effect of black hole spin on the magnetized torus\nevolution. However, we have not found any significant effect of black hole spin\non mass outflows in our model. Finally, we discuss the possible astrophysical\napplications of our simulation results.",

Some information on the composition can be inferred from the\ndeflections that charged ultra-high-energy cosmic rays experience while they\ntraverse intervening magnetic fields. Indeed, such deflections distort and\nsuppress the original anisotropy in the cosmic ray arrival directions; thus,\ngiven a source model, a measure of the anisotropy is also a measurement of the\ndeflections, which in turn informs us on the chemical composition. In this\nwork, we show that, by quantifying ultra-high-energy cosmic ray anisotropies\nthrough the angular cross-correlation between cosmic rays and galaxies, we\nwould be able to exclude iron fractions $f_{\\rm Fe}\\geq{\\cal O}(10\\%)$ assuming\na fiducial hydrogen map at $2\\,\\sigma$ level, and even smaller fractions in the\nreverse case of hydrogen on an iron map, going well below $f_{\\rm\nH}\\approx10\\%$ when we mask the Galactic Centre up to latitudes of $40^\\circ$.\nThis is an improvement of a factor of a few compared to our previous method,\nand is mostly ascribable to a new test statistics which is sensitive to each\nharmonic multipole individually.

Implications of these results include that there is\nno tidal disruption event \"missing energy problem\", that the optical and X-ray\nselected tidal disruption event populations are drawn from the same black hole\nmass distribution, that the early time optical luminosity in tidal disruption\nevents is somewhat simple, at least on the population level, and that future\nLSST observations will be able to constrain the black hole mass function at low\nmasses.",

The light curve exhibits\na long rise and decline timescale, with a large peak absolute magnitude of\nM$_g$ ~ -23.6, making it the most luminous of the classical optical TDEs (H,\nH+He, He) discovered to date by about 2 mag (and ~ 4 mag compared to the mean\nof the population). The light curve exhibits a persistent blue color of g - r ~\n-0.4 mag throughout its evolution, similar to other TDEs, but distinct from\nsupernovae. We identify the host galaxy of AT2023vto in archival Pan-STARRS\nimages and find that the transient is located at the galaxy center, and that\nits inferred central black hole mass is ~ $10^7~M_{\\odot}$. Modeling the light\ncurves of AT2023vto, we find that it resulted from the disruption of a ~ 9\n$M_{\\odot}$ star by a ~$10^7~M_{\\odot}$ supermassive black hole. The star mass\nis about 5 times larger than the highest star masses previously inferred in\nTDEs, and the black hole mass is at the high end of the distribution.
