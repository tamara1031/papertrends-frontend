          "abstract": "Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development\nand homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and\ntumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which\ndescribes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual\ncell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many\nphysiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of\ncontact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance\nof cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is\nstill debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as\nnumerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell\nensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact\ninhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a\nminimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by\nextending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells\nduring growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous\nin-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a\nsystematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell\ndynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of\nemergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective\ncell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the\ntransition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent\nregime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the\nvolume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only\ninter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a\nsize-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed\ncontact inhibition.",

          "abstract": "During migration cells exhibit a rich variety of seemingly random migration\npatterns, which makes unraveling the underlying mechanisms that control cell\nmigration a daunting challenge. For efficient migration cells require a\nmechanism for polarization, so that traction forces are produced in the\ndirection of motion, while adhesion is released to allow forward migration. To\nsimplify the study of this process cells have been studied when placed along\none-dimensional tracks, where single cells exhibit both smooth and stick-slip\nmigration modes. The stick-slip motility mode is characterized by protrusive\nmotion at the cell front, coupled with slow cell elongation, which is followed\nby rapid retractions of the cell back. In this study, we explore a minimal\nphysical model that couples the force applied on the adhesion bonds to the\nlength variations of the cell and the traction forces applied by the polarized\nactin retrograde flow. We show that the rich spectrum of cell migration\npatterns emerges from this model as different \\emph{deterministic} dynamical\nphases. This result suggests a source for the large cell-to-cell variability\n(CCV) in cell migration patterns observed in single cells over time and within\ncell populations. The large heterogeneity can arise from small fluctuations in\nthe cellular components that are greatly amplified due to moving the cells'\ninternal state across the dynamical phase transition lines. Temporal noise is\nshown to drive random changes in the cellular polarization direction, which is\nenhanced during the stick-slip migration mode. These results offer a new\nframework to explain experimental observations of migrating cells, resulting\nfrom noisy switching between underlying deterministic migration modes.",

          "abstract": "The coupling of the internal mechanisms of cell polarization to cell shape\ndeformations and subsequent cell crawling poses many interdisciplinary\nscientific challenges. Several mathematical approaches have been proposed to\nmodel the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods\nrelies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with\nthe integration of partial differential equations that account for the\npolarization mechanism inside the cell domain as defined by the phase field.\nThis approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single cells\nof the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to\nstudy actin-driven motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single\ncell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum is also well-known for its collective\nbehavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model for single cell\nmotility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting\namoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed\nnumerical simulations of this model, first characterizing the motion of single\ncells in terms of their polarity and velocity vectors. We then systematically\nstudied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic interaction\nscenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae. Finally,\nthe relevance of the cell density was analyzed, revealing a systematic decrease\nof the motility with density, associated with the formation of transient cell\nclusters that emerge in this system. This model is a prototypical active matter\nsystem for the investigation of the emergent collective dynamics of deformable,\nself-driven cells with a highly complex, nonlinear coupling of cell shape\ndeformations, self-propulsion and repulsive cell-cell interactions.",

The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories\nsuggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as\nlow-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the\ntheory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be\ncategorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory\nconnecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional\ngene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a\nphenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of\ndecision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our\nmodel combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and\nhigh-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate,\ngene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation\nof alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a\nmixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making\nclass. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and\nshow that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a\nheteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify\nuniversal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.",

Gene regulatory network\ndynamics are pivotal in controlling stem cell regeneration and cell type\ntransitions.

This study presents a computational\nframework connecting gene regulatory network dynamics with stem cell\nregeneration through a data-driven formulation of the inheritance function.

The proposed scheme enables us to derive the\ninheritance function based on the hybrid model of cross-cell-cycle gene\nregulation network dynamics.
