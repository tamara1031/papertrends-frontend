The previous statement is\nequivalent to claiming that almost all integers in $[2^n+1,2^{n+1}]$ will\niterate to a number less than $2^n$. This actually has been proved by many\nprevious results. But in this paper we prove this claim using different\nmethods. We also utilize our assumption on numbers in $[1,2^n]$ to show that\nthere are a set of integers (denoted by $p\\operatorname{-}C$) whose seem to be\nnot iterating to a number less than $2^n$, but since they are connected to\nCollatz numbers in $[1,2^n]$ they eventually will iterate to $1$. We address\nthe distribution of $p\\operatorname{-}C$ and give an explicit formula which\ncomputes a lower bound to the number of these integers. We also show\n(computationally) that the number of $p\\operatorname{-}C$ in a given interval\nis proportional to the numbers of another set of incidental Collatz numbers in\nthe same interval (whose distribution is completely unpredictable).",

          "year": "2020-06",
          "abstract": "A lemniscate is a curve defined by two foci, F1 and F2. If the distance\nbetween the focal points of F1 - F2 is 2a (a: constant), then any point P on\nthe lemniscate curve satisfy the equation PF1 PF2 = a^2. Jacob Bernoulli first\ndescribed the lemniscate in 1694. The Fagnano discovered the double angle\nformula of the lemniscate(1718). The Euler extended the Fagnano's formula to a\nmore general addition theorem(1751). The lemniscate function was subsequently\nproposed by Gauss around the year 1800. These insights are summarized by Jacobi\nas the theory of elliptic functions. A leaf function is an extended lemniscate\nfunction. Some formulas of leaf functions have been presented in previous\npapers; these included the addition theorem of this function and its\napplication to nonlinear equations. In this paper, the geometrical properties\nof leaf functions at n = 2 and the geometric relation between the angle theta\nand lemniscate arc length l are presented using the lemniscate curve. The\nrelationship between the leaf functions sleaf2(l) and cleaf2(l) is derived\nusing the geometrical properties of the lemniscate, similarity of triangles,\nand the Pythagorean theorem. In the literature, the relation equation for\nsleaf2(l) and cleaf2(l) (or the lemniscate functions, sl(l) and cl(l)) has been\nderived analytically; however, it is not derived geometrically.",

At first, four equivalent conditions to definition of a bipolar\nfuzzy soft hypervector space are presented, from different point of views.

Finally, normal bipolar fuzzy soft\nhypervector spaces is studied, as an especial kind of bipolar fuzzy soft\nhypervector spaces. All concepts are supported by interesting examples.",

          "abstract": "Taking into account that Rold\\'an et al.'s ample spectrum contractions have\nmanaged to extend and unify more than ten distinct families of contractive\nmappings in the setting of metric spaces, in this manuscript we present a first\nstudy on how such concept can be implemented in the more general framework of\nfuzzy metric spaces in the sense of Kramosil and Mich\\'alek. We introduce two\ndistinct approaches to the concept of fuzzy ample spectrum contractions and we\nprove general results about existence and uniqueness of fixed points. The\nproposed notions enjoys the following advantages with respect to previous\napproaches: (1) they permit to develop fixed point theory in a very general\nfuzzy framework (for instance, the underlying fuzzy space is not necessarily\ncomplete); (2) the procedures that we employ are able to overcome the technical\ndrawbacks raising in fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of Kramosil and\nMich\\'alek (that do not appear in fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of George\nand Veeramani); (3) we introduce a novel property about sequences that are not\nCauchy in a fuzzy space in order to consider a more general context than\nnon-Archimedean fuzzy metric spaces; (4) the contractivity condition associated\nto fuzzy ample spectrum contractions does not have to be expressed in separate\nvariables; (5) such fuzzy contractions generalize some well-known families of\nfuzzy contractive operators such that the class of all Mihet's fuzzy\n$\\psi$-contractions. As a consequence of these properties, this study gives a\npositive partial answer to a question posed by this author some years ago.",

          "abstract": "The Riemann Hypothesis, originally proposed by the eminent mathematician\nBernard Riemann in 1859, remains one of the most profound challenges in number\ntheory. It posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function\n{\\zeta}(s) are concentrated precisely along the critical line where the real\npart equals 1/2. In this paper, our aim is to present an attempt to prove this\nconjecture. Our approach relies on the use of the reflection formula. By\napplying this tool with precision and insight, we can conclusively establish\nthat {\\xi}(s)^2 (Riemann's {\\xi}-function) is valid only when Re(s)=1/2. As a\ndirect consequence of this determination, we can assert that every zero of both\n{\\xi}(s)^2 and {\\xi}(s) has a real part equal to 1/2. This, in turn, leads us\nto the tentative conclusion that the real part of all non-trivial zeros of the\nzeta function is consistently 1/2.",
