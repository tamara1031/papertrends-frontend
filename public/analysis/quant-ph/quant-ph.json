          "abstract": "Bell nonlocality -- the existence of quantum correlations that cannot be\nexplained by classical means -- is certainly one of the most striking features\nof quantum mechanics. Its range of applications in device-independent protocols\nis constantly growing. Many relevant quantum features can be inferred from\nviolations of Bell inequalities, including entanglement detection and\nquantification, and state certification applicable to systems of arbitrary\nnumber of particles. A complete characterisation of nonlocal correlations for\nmany-body systems is, however, a computationally intractable problem. Even if\none restricts the analysis to specific classes of states, no general method to\ntailor Bell inequalities to be violated by a given state is known. In this work\nwe provide a general construction of Bell inequalities that are maximally\nviolated by graph states of any prime local dimension. These form a broad class\nof multipartite quantum states that have many applications in quantum\ninformation, including quantum error correction. We analytically determine\ntheir maximal quantum violation, a number of high relevance for\ndevice-independent applications of Bell inequalities. Finally, we show that\nthese inequalities can be used for self-testing of multi-qutrit graph states\nsuch as the well-known four-qutrit absolutely maximally entangled state\nAME(4,3).",

          "abstract": "We study the task of localizing multipartite entanglement in pure quantum\nstates onto a subsystem by measuring the remaining systems. To this end, we fix\na multipartite entanglement measure and consider two quantities: the\nmultipartite entanglement of assistance (MEA), defined as the entanglement\nmeasure averaged over the post-measurement states and maximized over arbitrary\nmeasurements; and the localizable multipartite entanglement (LME), defined in\nthe same way but restricted to only local single-system measurements. We choose\nthe $n$-tangle, the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the\nconcentratable entanglement (CE) as the underlying seed measure, and discuss\nthe resulting MEA and LME quantities. First, we prove easily computable upper\nand lower bounds on MEA and LME and establish Lipschitz-continuity for the\n$n$-tangle and CE-based LME and MEA. Using these bounds we investigate the\ntypical behavior of entanglement localization by deriving concentration\ninequalities for the MEA evaluated on Haar-random states and performing\nnumerical studies for small tractable system sizes. We then turn our attention\nto protocols that transform graph states. We give a simple criterion based on a\nmatrix equation to decide whether states with a specified $n$-tangle value can\nbe obtained from a given graph state, providing no-go theorems for a broad\nclass of such graph state transformations beyond the usual local Clifford plus\nlocal Pauli measurement framework. We generalize this analysis to weighted\ngraph states and show that our entanglement localization framework certifies\nthe near-optimality of recently discussed local-measurement protocols to\ntransform uniformly weighted line graph states into GHZ states. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how our MEA and LEA quantities can be used to detect phase\ntransitions in transversal field Ising models.",

          "year": "2021-08",
          "abstract": "Genuine multipartite entanglement represents the strongest type of\nentanglement, which is an essential resource for quantum information\nprocessing. Standard methods to detect genuine multipartite entanglement, e.g.,\nentanglement witnesses, state tomography, or quantum state verification,\nrequire full knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension and precise calibration\nof measurement devices, which are usually difficult to acquire in an\nexperiment. The most radical way to overcome these problems is to detect\nentanglement solely based on the Bell-like correlations of measurement outcomes\ncollected in the experiment, namely, device-independently (DI). However, it is\ndifficult to certify genuine entanglement of practical multipartite states in\nthis way, and even more difficult to quantify it, due to the difficulty to\nidentify optimal multipartite Bell inequalities and protocols tolerant to state\nimpurity. In this work, we explore a general and robust DI method which can be\napplied to various realistic multipartite quantum state in arbitrary finite\ndimension, while merely relying on bipartite Bell inequalities. Our method\nallows us both to certify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement and\nto quantify it. Several important classes of entangled states are tested with\nthis method, leading to the detection of genuinely entangled states. We also\ncertify genuine multipartite entanglement in weakly-entangled GHZ states, thus\nshowing that the method applies equally well to less standard states.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body\nsystems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact\ndiagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct\nconnection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point\nattractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties\nof the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as\nquantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics\nof the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with\nregular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising\nfrom chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries\nconstrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and\nenforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of\nthe phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize\nphase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation\nratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's\nsupport. We find that the entropy scales as $S \\propto \\ln N^D$, consistently\ncapturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical\nframework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully\nreproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as\nspectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that\ndissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much\nlike in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and\nsymmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and\nphase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying\nergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.",

          "abstract": "The spectral form factor (SFF) captures universal spectral fluctuations as\nsignatures of quantum chaos, and has been instrumental in advancing multiple\nfrontiers of physics including the studies of black holes and quantum many-body\nsystems. However, the measurement of SFF in many-body systems is challenging\ndue to the difficulty in resolving level spacings that become exponentially\nsmall with increasing system size.

Second, recent\nstudies show that dynamic circuits can significantly outperform purely unitary\nones.

          "abstract": "With the emergence of the Quantum Internet, the need for advanced quantum\nnetworking techniques has significantly risen. Various models of quantum\nrepeaters have been presented, each delineating a unique strategy to ensure\nquantum communication over long distances. We focus on repeaters that employ\nentanglement generation and swapping. This revolves around establishing remote\nend-to-end entanglement through repeaters, a concept we denote as the\n\"quantum-native\" repeaters (also called \"first-generation\" repeaters in some\nliterature). The challenges in routing with quantum-native repeaters arise from\nprobabilistic entanglement generation and restricted coherence time. Current\napproaches use synchronized time slots to search for entanglement-swapping\npaths, resulting in inefficiencies. Here, we propose a new set of asynchronous\nrouting protocols for quantum networks by incorporating the idea of maintaining\na dynamic topology in a distributed manner, which has been extensively studied\nin classical routing for lossy networks, such as using a destination-oriented\ndirected acyclic graph (DODAG) or a spanning tree. The protocols update the\nentanglement-link topology asynchronously, identify optimal\nentanglement-swapping paths, and preserve unused direct-link entanglements. Our\nresults indicate that asynchronous protocols achieve a larger upper bound with\nan appropriate setting and significantly higher entanglement rate than existing\nsynchronous approaches, and the rate increases with coherence time, suggesting\nthat it will have a much more profound impact on quantum networks as technology\nadvances.",

          "abstract": "Long-range entanglement distribution in a quantum network relies on\nentanglement swapping at intermediate nodes along a network path to connect\nshort-range entangled states established over the network edges. The end-to-end\nentanglement of a network path obtained via this process determines the utility\nof the network path for executing entanglement enabled tasks and for the design\nof entanglement routing protocols in the quantum network. Here, we study the\nend-to-end entanglement of paths in a quantum network when the edges are\ncharacterised by multi-parameter quantum states that may be considered to be\nthe output of arbitrary and unknown quantum channels described by the network's\nedges. We find that over ensembles of multi-parameter states with fixed\nconcurrence but varying density matrix elements, the end-to-end entanglement\ntakes a range of values upper bounded by a function of the concurrence of the\nnetwork-edge states. The scaling behaviour of the average end-to-end\nentanglement reveals that its distribution gets increasingly concentrated\naround the mean as the paths become longer. For a network path of a given\nlength, the average end-to-end entanglement vanishes for edge concurrence\nvalues below a threshold that increases with the path-length. Whereas, for edge\nconcurrence values greater than the threshold the average end-to-end\nentanglement increases faster with the length of the path. As an implication of\nour results, we show that the optimal path for entanglement distribution\nbetween a pair of end nodes, connected by alternate paths with multi-parameter\nstates along the edges, can be indeterminate given only entanglement guarantees\nalong the network edges.",

The extent and quality of distributed entanglement in a quantum\nnetwork, that is its functionality, depends on its topology, edge-parameter\ndistributions and the distribution protocol. We uncover the parametric\nentanglement topography and introduce the notion of typical and maximal viable\nregions for entanglement-enabled tasks in a general model of large-scale\nquantum networks. We show that such a topographical analysis, in terms of\nviability regions, reveals important functional information about quantum\nnetworks, provides experimental targets for the edge parameters and can guide\nefficient quantum network design. Applied to a photonic quantum network, such a\ntopographical analysis shows that in a network with radius $10^3$ kms and 1500\nnodes, arbitrary pairs of nodes can establish quantum secure keys at a rate of\n$R_{sec}=1$ kHz using $1$ MHz entanglement generation sources on the edges and\nas few as 3 entanglement swappings at intermediate nodes along network paths.",

          "abstract": "The mobile impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a paradigmatic\nmany-body problem. For weak interaction between the impurity and the BEC, the\nimpurity deforms the BEC only slightly and it is well described within the\nFr\\\"ohlich model and the Bogoliubov approximation. For strong local attraction\nthis standard approach, however, fails to balance the local attraction with the\nweak repulsion between the BEC particles and predicts an instability where an\ninfinite number of bosons is attracted toward the impurity. Here we present a\nsolution of the Bose polaron problem beyond the Bogoliubov approximation which\nincludes the local repulsion between bosons and thereby stabilizes the Bose\npolaron even near and beyond the scattering resonance. We show that the Bose\npolaron energy remains bounded from below across the resonance and the size of\nthe polaron dressing cloud stays finite. Our results demonstrate how the\ndressing cloud replaces the attractive impurity potential with an effective\nmany-body potential that excludes binding. We find that at resonance, including\nthe effects of boson repulsion, the polaron energy depends universally on the\neffective range. Moreover, while the impurity contact is strongly peaked at\npositive scattering length, it remains always finite. Our solution highlights\nhow Bose polarons are self-stabilized by repulsion, providing a mechanism to\nunderstand quench dynamics and nonequilibrium time evolution at strong\ncoupling.",

This system\nalso reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator\nbackground due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The\ngrowth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the\ntransition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system.

          "abstract": "We investigate the formation of magnetic Bose polaron, an impurity atom\ndressed by spin-wave excitations, in a one-dimensional spinor Bose gas. In\nterms of an effective potential model the impurity is strongly confined by the\nhost excitations which can even overcome the impurity-medium repulsion leading\nto a self-localized quasi-particle state. The phase diagram of the attractive\nand self-bound repulsive magnetic polaron, repulsive non-magnetic (Fr{\\\"\no}hlich-type) polaron and impurity-medium phase-separation regimes is explored\nwith respect to the Rabi-coupling between the spin components, spin-spin\ninteractions and impurity-medium coupling.

The impurity can be used to probe and maneuver the\nspin polarization of the magnetic medium while suppressing ferromagnetic\nspin-spin correlations.
