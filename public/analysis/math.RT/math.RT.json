We solve\nthis hay in a haystack problem by constructing explicit tensors that are\nnon-free for every $n \\geq 3$. In particular, this establishes that non-free\ntensors exist in $\\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^n$,\nwhere they are not generic.\n  To establish non-freeness, we use results from geometric invariant theory and\nthe theory of moment polytopes. In particular, we show that if a tensor $T$ is\nfree, then there is a tensor $S$ in the GL-orbit closure of $T$, whose support\nis free and whose moment map image is the minimum-norm point of the moment\npolytope of $T$. This implies a reduction for checking non-freeness from\narbitrary basis changes of $T$ to unitary basis changes of $S$. The unitary\nequivariance of the moment map can then be combined with the fact that tensors\nwith free support have diagonal moment map image, in order to further restrict\nthe set of relevant basis changes.",

          "abstract": "We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors,\nunder natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and\nsymplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis\nand quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions.\nFirst, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the\ncomplexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the\ngeneral linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or\nsymplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different\nactions.\n  Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups\nacting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding\nproblem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary\ngroups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are\npolynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the\n3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d>3. For unitary groups, the\npreceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states\nis at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for\nany d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the\ntensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.",

Our main technical result is an\nexplicit formula for the action of the walled Brauer algebra generators in the\nGelfand-Tsetlin basis. It generalizes the well-known Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for\nthe symmetric group (also known as Young's orthogonal form or Young-Yamanouchi\nbasis).\n  We provide two applications of our result to quantum information. First, we\nshow how to simplify semidefinite optimization problems over\nunitary-equivariant quantum channels by performing a symmetry reduction.\nSecond, we derive an efficient quantum circuit for implementing the optimal\nport-based quantum teleportation protocol, exponentially improving the known\ntrivial construction. As a consequence, this also exponentially improves the\nknown lower bound for the amount of entanglement needed to implement unitaries\nnon-locally.\n  Both applications require a generalization of quantum Schur transform to\ntensors of mixed unitary symmetry. We develop an efficient quantum circuit for\nthis mixed quantum Schur transform and provide a matrix product state\nrepresentation of its basis vectors.
