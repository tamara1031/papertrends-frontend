They work best when the target of a representation is a dual Banach\nalgebra. For representations on dual Banach spaces, they allow to extend\nrepresentations to twisted Borel convolution algebras, which is crucial when\nthe groupoid is non-Hausdorff.\n  We establish fundamental norm estimates and hierarchy for full and reduced\n$L^p$-operator algebras for $(\\mathcal{G},\\mathcal{L})$ and $p \\in [1,\\infty]$,\nwhose special cases have been studied recently by Gardella-Lupini,\nChoi-Gardella-Thiel and Hetland-Ortega.

Our strategy is a variational\napproach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or\nregularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results\nwhich yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated\nLions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms.

Among other results, we show that operators\nsatisfying the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion are hereditarily frequently\nhypercyclic, as well as a large class of operators whose unimodular\neigenvectors are spanning with respect to the Lebesgue measure. On the other\nhand, we exhibit two frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts $B_w,B_{w'}$ on\n$c_0(\\mathbb{Z}_+)$ whose direct sum $B_w\\oplus B_{w'}$ is not\n$\\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic (so that neither of them is hereditarily\nfrequently hypercyclic), and we construct a $C$-type operator on\n$\\ell_p(\\mathbb{Z}_+)$, $1\\le p<\\infty$ which is frequently hypercyclic but not\nhereditarily frequently hypercyclic. We also solve several problems concerning\ndisjoint frequent hypercyclicity: we show that for every $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$, any\ndisjoint frequently hypercyclic $N$-tuple of operators $(T_1,\\dots ,T_N)$ can\nbe extended to a disjoint frequently hypercyclic $(N+1)$-tuple $(T_1,\\dots\n,T_N, T_{N+1})$ as soon as the underlying space supports a hereditarily\nfrequently hypercyclic operator; we construct a disjoint frequently hypercyclic\npair which is not densely disjoint hypercyclic; and we show that the pair\n$(D,\\tau_a)$ is disjoint frequently hypercyclic, where $D$ is the derivation\noperator acting on the space of entire functions and $\\tau_a$ is the operator\nof translation by $a\\in\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{ 0\\}$.
