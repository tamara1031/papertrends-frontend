          "year": "2024-10",
          "abstract": "In combinatorics on words, a classical topic of study is the number of\nspecific patterns appearing in infinite sequences. For instance, many works\nhave been dedicated to studying the so-called factor complexity of infinite\nsequences, which gives the number of different factors (contiguous subblocks of\ntheir symbols), as well as abelian complexity, which counts factors up to a\npermutation of letters. In this paper, we consider the relatively unexplored\nconcept of additive complexity, which counts the number of factors up to\nadditive equivalence. We say that two words are additively equivalent if they\nhave the same length and the total weight of their letters is equal. Our\ncontribution is to expand the general knowledge of additive complexity from a\ntheoretical point of view and consider various famous examples. We show a\nparticular case of an analog of the long-standing conjecture on the regularity\nof the abelian complexity of an automatic sequence. In particular, we use the\nformalism of logic, and the software Walnut, to decide related properties of\nautomatic sequences. We compare the behaviors of additive and abelian\ncomplexities, and we also consider the notion of abelian and additive powers.\nAlong the way, we present some open questions and conjectures for future work.",

          "abstract": "We study complexity and periodicity of Delone sets by applying an algebraic\napproach to multidimensional symbolic dynamics. In this algebraic approach,\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations $c: \\mathbb{Z}^d \\to \\mathcal{A}$ for a finite\nset $\\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ and finite $\\mathbb{Z}^d$-patterns are\nregarded as formal power series and Laurent polynomials, respectively. In this\npaper we study also functions $c: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathcal{A}$ where\n$\\mathcal{A}$ is as above. These functions are called\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. Any Delone set may be regarded as an\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration by simply presenting it as its indicator function.\nConversely, any $\\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration whose support (that is, the set of\ncells for which the configuration gets non-zero values) is a Delone set can be\nseen as a colored Delone set. We generalize the concept of annihilators and\nperiodizers of $\\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations for $\\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations.\nWe show that if an $\\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration has a non-trivial annihilator,\nthat is, if a linear combination of some finitely many of its translations is\nthe zero function, then it has an annihilator of a particular form. Moreover,\nwe show that $\\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations with integer coefficients that have\nnon-trivial annihilators are sums of finitely many periodic functions\n$c_1,\\ldots,c_m: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. Also, $\\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern\ncomplexity is studied alongside with the classical patch-complexity of Delone\nsets. We point out the fact that sufficiently low $\\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern\ncomplexity of an $\\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration implies the existence of\nnon-trivial annihilators. Moreover, it is shown that if a Meyer set has\nsufficiently slow patch-complexity growth, then it has a non-trivial\nannihilator. Finally, a condition for forced periodicity of colored Delone sets\nof finite local complexity is provided.",

          "abstract": "We have introduced a q-deformation, i.e., a polynomial in q with natural\ncoefficients, of the binomial coefficient of two finite words u and v counting\nthe number of occurrences of v as a subword of u. In this paper, we examine the\nq-deformation of Parikh matrices as introduced by E\\u{g}ecio\\u{g}lu in 2004.\n  Many classical results concerning Parikh matrices generalize to this new\nframework: Our first important observation is that the elements of such a\nmatrix are in fact q-deformations of binomial coefficients of words. We also\nstudy their inverses and as an application, we obtain new identities about\nq-binomials.\n  For a finite word z and for the sequence $(p_n)_{n\\ge 0}$ of prefixes of an\ninfinite word, we show that the polynomial sequence $\\binom{p_n}{z}_q$\nconverges to a formal series.

It would be interesting to note that the open packing\nnumber is a lower bound for the total domination number in graphs with no\nisolated vertices [Henning and Slater, 1999]. Given a graph $G$ and a positive\ninteger $k$, the decision problem OPEN PACKING tests whether $G$ has an open\npacking of size at least $k$. The optimization problem MAX-OPEN PACKING takes a\ngraph $G$ as input and finds the open packing number of $G$. It is known that\nOPEN PACKING is NP-complete on split graphs (i.e., $\\{2K_2,C_4,C_5\\}$-free\ngraphs) [Ramos et al., 2014]. In this work, we complete the study on the\ncomplexity (P vs NPC) of OPEN PACKING on $H$-free graphs for every graph $H$\nwith at least three vertices by proving that OPEN PACKING is (i) NP-complete on\n$K_{1,3}$-free graphs and (ii) polynomial time solvable on $(P_4\\cup\nrK_1)$-free graphs for every $r\\geq 1$. In the course of proving (ii), we show\nthat for every $t\\in {2,3,4}$ and $r\\geq 1$, if G is a $(P_t\\cup rK_1)$-free\ngraph, then $\\rho^o(G)$ is bounded above by a linear function of $r$. Moreover,\nwe show that OPEN PACKING parameterized by solution size is W[1]-complete on\n$K_{1,3}$-free graphs and MAX-OPEN PACKING is hard to approximate within a\nfactor of $n^{(\\frac{1}{2}-\\delta)}$ for any $\\delta>0$ on $K_{1,3}$-free\ngraphs unless P=NP. Further, we prove that OPEN PACKING is (a) NP-complete on\n$K_{1,4}$-free split graphs and (b) polynomial time solvable on $K_{1,3}$-free\nsplit graphs.

The minimum number of cops\nneeded to win the game on a graph $G$ is the $k$-hyperopic cop number\n$c_{H,k}(G)$ of $G$.\n  In addition to basic properties of the new invariant, cop-win graphs are\ncharacterized and a general upper bound in terms of the matching number of the\ngraph is given. The invariant is also studied on trees where the upper bounds\nmostly depend on the relation between $k$ and the diameter of the tree. It is\nalso proven that the 2-hyperopic cop number of outerplanar graphs is at most 2\nand an upper bound in terms of the number of vertices of the graph is presented\nfor $k \\geq 3$.",

          "abstract": "Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to\ncapture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first\nconsists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn,\nevery cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent\nvertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be\ncaptured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the\nrobber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph --\nthe minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known\nthat graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have\nbounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that\ncan be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have\nbounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance\nbetween crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular,\nwe look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game,\nwhere the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance\n$d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in\nthe graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various\nclasses of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each\nedge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show\nthat if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small\nlength, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.",
