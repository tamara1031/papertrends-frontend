          "year": "2025-04",
          "abstract": "O-RAN (Open-Radio Access Network) offers a flexible, open architecture for\nnext-generation wireless networks. Network slicing within O-RAN allows network\noperators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the\nspecific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing\nthese slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized\nsoftware applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In\nnetwork slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network\nslice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these\nxApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely\ncan lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper,\nwe address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative\nZero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN.\nOur approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable\nxApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant\nmanual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based\nattention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead\nand improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL,\nwhere all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The\nfindings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number\nof xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for\noptimal network slicing management in O-RAN.",

          "year": "2021-09",
          "abstract": "Network slicing is a critical technique for 5G communications that covers\nradio access network (RAN), edge, transport and core slicing.The evolving\nnetwork architecture requires the orchestration of multiple network resources\nsuch as radio and cache resources. In recent years, machine learning (ML)\ntechniques have been widely applied for network management. However, most\nexisting works do not take advantage of the knowledge transfer capability in\nML. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer reinforcement learning (DTRL)\nscheme for joint radio and cache resource allocation to serve 5G RAN slicing.\nWe first define a hierarchical architecture for joint resource allocation. Then\nwe propose two DTRL algorithms: Q-value-based deep transfer reinforcement\nlearning (QDTRL) and action selection-based deep transfer reinforcement\nlearning (ADTRL). In the proposed schemes, learner agents utilize expert\nagents' knowledge to improve their performance on current tasks. The proposed\nalgorithms are compared with both the model-free exploration bonus deep\nQ-learning (EB-DQN) and the model-based priority proportional fairness and\ntime-to-live (PPF-TTL) algorithms. Compared with EB-DQN, our proposed\nDTRL-based method presents 21.4% lower delay for Ultra Reliable Low Latency\nCommunications (URLLC) slice and 22.4% higher throughput for enhanced Mobile\nBroad Band (eMBB) slice, while achieving significantly faster convergence than\nEB-DQN. Moreover, 40.8% lower URLLC delay and 59.8% higher eMBB throughput are\nobserved with respect to PPF-TTL.",

          "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly used in our everyday lives\nas well as in numerous industrial applications. However, due to limitations in\ncomputing and power capabilities, IoT devices need to send their respective\ntasks to cloud service stations that are usually located at far distances.\nHaving to transmit data far distances introduces challenges for services that\nrequire low latency such as industrial control in factories and plants as well\nas artificial intelligence assisted autonomous driving. To solve this issue,\nmobile edge computing (MEC) is deployed at the networks edge to reduce\ntransmission time. In this regard, this study proposes a new offloading scheme\nfor MEC-assisted ultra dense cellular networks using reinforcement learning\n(RL) techniques. The proposed scheme enables efficient resource allocation and\ndynamic offloading decisions based on varying network conditions and user\ndemands. The RL algorithm learns from the networks historical data and adapts\nthe offloading decisions to optimize the networks overall performance.\nNon-orthogonal multiple access is also adopted to improve resource utilization\namong the IoT devices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme\noutperforms other stateof the art offloading algorithms in terms of energy\nefficiency, network throughput, and user satisfaction.",

We consider some\nquantum networks of practical interest, ranging from satellite-based networks\nconnecting far-off spatial locations to currently available quantum processor\narchitectures within computers, and analyze their robustness to perform quantum\ninformation processing tasks. Some of these tasks form primitives for delegated\nquantum computing, e.g., entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation.\nFor some examples of quantum networks, we present algorithms to perform\ndifferent quantum network tasks of interest such as constructing the network\nstructure, finding the shortest path between a pair of end nodes, and\noptimizing the flow of resources at a node.",

Multiple interacting\nquantum walks can be used to propagate entangled control signals across the\nnetwork in parallel.
