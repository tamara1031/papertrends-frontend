          "abstract": "Emotion recognition based on EEG (electroencephalography) has been widely\nused in human-computer interaction, distance education and health care.\nHowever, the conventional methods ignore the adjacent and symmetrical\ncharacteristics of EEG signals, which also contain salient information related\nto emotion. In this paper, a spatial folding ensemble network (SFE-Net) is\npresented for EEG feature extraction and emotion recognition. Firstly, for the\nundetected area between EEG electrodes, an improved Bicubic-EEG interpolation\nalgorithm is developed for EEG channels information completion, which allows us\nto extract a wider range of adjacent space features. Then, motivated by the\nspatial symmetric mechanism of human brain, we fold the input EEG channels data\nwith five different symmetrical strategies, which enable the proposed network\nto extract the information of space features of EEG signals more effectively.\nFinally, a 3DCNN-based spatial, temporal extraction, and a multi-voting\nstrategy of ensemble learning are integrated to model a new neural network.\nWith this network, the spatial features of different symmetric folding signals\ncan be extracted simultaneously, which greatly improves the robustness and\naccuracy of emotion recognition. The experimental results on DEAP and SEED\ndatasets show that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance in terms\nof recognition accuracy.",

In this study, the hand kinematics decoding for grasp\nand lift task is performed in three-dimensional (3D) space using scalp\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Twelve subjects from the publicly available\ndatabase WAY-EEG-GAL, has been utilized in this study. In particular,\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network-long short-term\nmemory (CNN-LSTM) based deep learning frameworks are proposed that utilize the\nmotor-neural information encoded in the pre-movement EEG data. Spectral\nfeatures are analyzed for hand kinematics decoding using EEG data filtered in\nseven frequency ranges. The best performing frequency band spectral features\nhas been considered for further analysis with different EEG window sizes and\nlag windows. Appropriate lag windows from movement onset, make the approach\npre-movement in true sense. Additionally, inter-subject hand trajectory\ndecoding analysis is performed using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) approach. The\nPearson correlation coefficient and hand trajectory are considered as\nperformance metric to evaluate decoding performance for the neural decoders.\nThis study explores the feasibility of inter-subject 3-D hand trajectory\ndecoding using EEG signals only during reach and grasp task, probably for the\nfirst time.

          "abstract": "In the context of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based driver drowsiness\nrecognition, it is still challenging to design a calibration-free system, since\nEEG signals vary significantly among different subjects and recording sessions.\nMany efforts have been made to use deep learning methods for mental state\nrecognition from EEG signals. However, existing work mostly treats deep\nlearning models as black-box classifiers, while what have been learned by the\nmodels and to which extent they are affected by the noise in EEG data are still\nunderexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel convolutional neural network\ncombined with an interpretation technique that allows sample-wise analysis of\nimportant features for classification. The network has a compact structure and\ntakes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a\nspatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average\naccuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness\nrecognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of\n53.40%-72.68% and state-of-the-art deep learning methods of 71.75%-75.19%.\nInterpretation results indicate the model has learned to recognize biologically\nmeaningful features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong\nindicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also\nexplore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples with the interpretation\ntechnique and discuss potential ways to improve the recognition accuracy.

In this paper, we explore both the positive and negative sides of\nhaving a RIS in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC\nnetwork. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the\nactive and passive beamforming vectors that maximize the sensing\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget.\nWe also investigate the destructive potential of the RIS by devising a RIS\nphase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the sensing SNR while\npreserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the\nsystem. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element\nfailures on the system performance.

          "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is promising for future 6G wireless\ncommunications. However, the increased number of RIS elements results in the\nhigh overhead for channel acquisition and the non-negligible power consumption.\nTherefore, how to improve the system capacity with limited RIS elements is\nessential. Unlike the classical regular RIS whose elements are arranged on a\nregular grid, in this paper, we propose an irregular RIS structure to improve\nthe system capacity. The key idea is to irregularly configure a given number of\nRIS elements on an enlarged surface, which provides extra spatial degrees of\nfreedom compared with the regular RIS. In this way, the received signal power\ncan be enhanced, and thus the system capacity can be improved. Then, we\nformulate a joint topology and precoding optimization problem to maximize the\ncapacity for irregular RIS-aided communication systems. Accordingly, a joint\noptimization algorithm with low complexity is proposed to alternately optimize\nthe RIS topology and the precoding design. Particularly, a tabu search-based\nmethod is used to design the irregular RIS topology, and a neighbor\nextraction-based cross-entropy method is introduced to optimize the precoding\ndesign. Simulation results demonstrate that, subject to the constraint of\nlimited RIS elements, the proposed irregular RIS can significantly enhance the\nsystem capacity.",

Thus, this paper investigates the performance of various\nRIS technologies like regular (reflective and passive), simultaneously transmit\nand reflect (STAR), and multi-sector beyond diagonal (BD) RIS in multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM broadcast channels (BC). This\nrequires to formulate and solve a joint MIMO precoding and RIS optimization\nproblem.

          "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are recognised as one of\nthe key ingredients of the sixth generation (6G) network. A challenging topic\nin ISAC is the design of a single waveform combining both communication and\nsensing functionalities on the same time-frequency-space resources, allowing to\ntune the performance of both with partial or full hardware sharing. This paper\nproposes a dual-domain waveform design approach that superposes onto the\nfrequency-time (FT) domain both the legacy orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) signal and a sensing one, purposely designed in the\ndelay-Doppler domain. With a proper power downscaling of the sensing signal\nw.r.t.

Numerical and experimental\nresults prove the effectiveness of the dual-domain waveform, notwithstanding a\npower abatement of at least 30 dB of the signal used for sensing compared to\nthe one used for communication.

Specifically, we\nintroduce meta-learning, where the learning rates are manipulated using the\nmeta-learning idea to maximize the gradient for each client in each global\nround. Clients with varying processing capacities, data sizes, and batch sizes\ncan participate in global model aggregation and improve their local load\nforecasting via personalized learning. Simulation results show that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art ML and FL methods in terms of better load\nforecasting accuracy.",

Since the\ndedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,\nWPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically\ncharacterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and\nreveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we\nfurther derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is\nactivated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when\nWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on\nthe devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.\nSimulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.",

To\ntackle these issues, an iterative 2-D DOA estimation approach based on tensor\nmodeling is proposed. To develop such approach, a higher-order tensor is\nconstructed, whose factor matrices contain the sources azimuth and elevation\ninformation. By exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a\ncomputationally efficient tensor decomposition method is then developed to\nestimate the sources DOA information in each dimension independently. The\npair-matching of the azimuth and elevation angles is conducted via the\ncross-correlation matrix (CCM) of the received signals. An iterative method is\nfurther designed to improve the DOA estimation performance. Specifically, the\ncross term is estimated and removed in the next step of such iterative\nprocedure on the basis of the DOA estimates originated from the tensor\ndecomposition in the previous step. As a consequence, the DOA estimation with\nbetter accuracy and higher resolution is obtained. The proposed iterative 2-D\nDOA estimation method for the L-shaped nested array can resolve more sources\nthan the number of real elements, which is superior to conventional approaches.\nSimulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed 2-D DOA\nestimation method as compared to existing state-of-the-art DOA estimation\ntechniques for the L-shaped nested array.",

          "abstract": "Internet traffic in the real world is susceptible to various external and\ninternal factors which may abruptly change the normal traffic flow. Those\nunexpected changes are considered outliers in traffic. However, deep sequence\nmodels have been used to predict complex IP traffic, but their comparative\nperformance for anomalous traffic has not been studied extensively. In this\npaper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of different deep sequence\nmodels for anomalous traffic prediction. Several deep sequences models were\nimplemented to predict real traffic without and with outliers and show the\nsignificance of outlier detection in real-world traffic prediction. First, two\ndifferent outlier detection techniques, such as the Three-Sigma rule and\nIsolation Forest, were applied to identify the anomaly. Second, we adjusted\nthose abnormal data points using the Backward Filling technique before training\nthe model. Finally, the performance of different models was compared for\nabnormal and adjusted traffic. LSTM_Encoder_Decoder (LSTM_En_De) is the best\nprediction model in our experiment, reducing the deviation between actual and\npredicted traffic by more than 11\\% after adjusting the outliers. All other\nmodels, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM), LSTM_En_De with Attention layer (LSTM_En_De_Atn), Gated Recurrent Unit\n(GRU), show better prediction after replacing the outliers and decreasing\nprediction error by more than 29%, 24%, 19%, and 10% respectively. Our\nexperimental results indicate that the outliers in the data can significantly\nimpact the quality of the prediction. Thus, outlier detection and mitigation\nassist the deep sequence model in learning the general trend and making better\npredictions.",

To capture\nthese characteristics, we propose a novel method named PCNN based on deep\nConvolutional Neural Network, modeling Periodic traffic data for short-term\ntraffic congestion prediction. PCNN has two pivotal procedures: time series\nfolding and multi-grained learning. It first temporally folds the time series\nand constructs a two-dimensional matrix as the network input, such that both\nthe real-time traffic conditions and past traffic patterns are well considered;\nthen with a series of convolutions over the input matrix, it is able to model\nthe local temporal dependency and multiscale traffic patterns. In particular,\nthe global trend of congestion can be addressed at the macroscale; whereas more\ndetails and variations of the congestion can be captured at the microscale.\nExperimental results on a real-world urban traffic dataset confirm that folding\ntime series data into a two-dimensional matrix is effective and PCNN\noutperforms the baselines significantly for the task of short-term congestion\nprediction.",

          "abstract": "Huge overhead of beam training imposes a significant challenge in\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communications. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a wide beam based training approach to calibrate the\nnarrow beam direction according to the channel power leakage. To handle the\ncomplex nonlinear properties of the channel power leakage, deep learning is\nutilized to predict the optimal narrow beam directly. Specifically, three deep\nlearning assisted calibrated beam training schemes are proposed. The first\nscheme adopts convolution neural network to implement the prediction based on\nthe instantaneous received signals of wide beam training. We also perform the\nadditional narrow beam training based on the predicted probabilities for\nfurther beam direction calibrations. However, the first scheme only depends on\none wide beam training, which lacks the robustness to noise. To tackle this\nproblem, the second scheme adopts long-short term memory (LSTM) network for\ntracking the movement of users and calibrating the beam direction according to\nthe received signals of prior beam training, in order to enhance the robustness\nto noise. To further reduce the overhead of wide beam training, our third\nscheme, an adaptive beam training strategy, selects partial wide beams to be\ntrained based on the prior received signals. Two criteria, namely, optimal\nneighboring criterion and maximum probability criterion, are designed for the\nselection. Furthermore, to handle mobile scenarios, auxiliary LSTM is\nintroduced to calibrate the directions of the selected wide beams more\nprecisely.
