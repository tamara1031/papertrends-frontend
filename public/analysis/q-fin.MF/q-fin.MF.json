          "abstract": "Rough volatility models have recently been empirically shown to provide a\ngood fit to historical volatility time series and implied volatility smiles of\nSPX options. They are continuous-time stochastic volatility models, whose\nvolatility process is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst\nparameter less than half. Due to the challenge that it is neither a\nsemimartingale nor a Markov process, there is no unified method that not only\napplies to all rough volatility models, but also is computationally efficient.\nThis paper proposes a semimartingale and continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)\napproximation approach for the general class of rough stochastic local\nvolatility (RSLV) models. In particular, we introduce the perturbed stochastic\nlocal volatility (PSLV) model as the semimartingale approximation for the RSLV\nmodel and establish its existence , uniqueness and Markovian representation. We\npropose a fast CTMC algorithm and prove its weak convergence. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of the method in\npricing European, barrier and American options. Comparing with existing\nliterature, a significant reduction in the CPU time to arrive at the same level\nof accuracy is observed.",

In our model,\nnamed the rough Hawkes Heston stochastic volatility model, the spot variance is\na rough Hawkes-type process proportional to the intensity process of the jump\ncomponent appearing in the dynamics of the spot variance itself and the log\nreturns. The model belongs to the class of affine Volterra models. In\nparticular, the Fourier-Laplace transform of the log returns and the square of\nthe volatility index can be computed explicitly in terms of solutions of\ndeterministic Riccati-Volterra equations, which can be efficiently approximated\nusing a multi-factor approximation technique. We calibrate a parsimonious\nspecification of our model characterized by a power kernel and an exponential\nlaw for the jumps. We show that our parsimonious setup is able to\nsimultaneously capture, with a high precision, the behavior of the implied\nvolatility smile for both S&P 500 and VIX options. In particular, we observe\nthat in our setting the usual shift in the implied volatility of VIX options is\nexplained by a very low value of the power in the kernel. Our findings\ndemonstrate the relevance, under an affine framework, of rough volatility and\nself-exciting jumps in order to capture the joint evolution of the S&P 500 and\nVIX.",

          "abstract": "This dissertation develops and justifies a novel method for deriving\napproximate formulas to estimate two parameters in stochastic volatility\ndiffusion models with exponentially-affine characteristic functions and single-\nor two-factor variance. These formulas aim to improve the accuracy of option\npricing and enhance the calibration process by providing reliable initial\nvalues for local minimization algorithms. The parameters relate to the\nvolatility of the stochastic factor in instantaneous variance dynamics and the\ncorrelation between stochastic factors and asset price dynamics.\n  The study comprises five chapters. Chapter one outlines the currency option\nmarket, pricing methods, and the general structure of stochastic volatility\nmodels. Chapter two derives the replication strategy dynamics and introduces a\nnew two-factor volatility model: the OUOU model. Chapter three analyzes the\ndistribution and surface dynamics of implied volatilities using principal\ncomponent and common factor analysis. Chapter four discusses calibration\nmethods for stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston model, and\npresents the new Implied Central Moments method to estimate parameters in the\nHeston and Sch\\\"obel-Zhu models. Extensions to two-factor models, Bates and\nOUOU, are also explored. Chapter five evaluates the performance of the proposed\nformulas on the EURUSD options market, demonstrating the superior accuracy of\nthe new method.\n  The dissertation successfully meets its research objectives, expanding tools\nfor derivative pricing and risk assessment. Key contributions include faster\nand more precise parameter estimation formulas and the introduction of the OUOU\nmodel - an extension of the Sch\\\"obel-Zhu model with a semi-analytical\nvaluation formula for European options, previously unexamined in the\nliterature.",

The state of each player follows a geometric Brownian\nmotion, controlled additively through a nondecreasing process, while agents\nseek to maximize a long-term average reward functional with a power-type\ninstantaneous profit, under strategic complementarity. We explore three\ndifferent notions of optimality, which, in the mean-field limit, correspond to\nthe mean-field control solution, mean-field coarse correlated equilibria, and\nmean-field Nash equilibria. We explicitly compute equilibria in the three cases\nand compare them numerically, in terms of yielded payoffs and existence\nconditions.

Our analysis of the mean-field control problem features a novel Lagrange\nmultiplier approach, which proves crucial in establishing the approximation\nresult, while the treatment of mean-field coarse correlated equilibria\nnecessitates a new, specifically tailored definition for the stationary\nsetting.",

The parameter combinations that we consider\nin this paper are such that the risk aversion parameter $R$ and the elasticity\nof intertemporal complementarity $S$ satisfy $\\theta=\\frac{1-R}{1-S}>1$.

To deal with this issue, we introduce the\neconomically motivated notion of a proper utility process, where, roughly\nspeaking, a utility process is proper if it is nonzero whenever future\nconsumption is nonzero.\n  We then proceed to show that for a very wide class of consumption streams\n$C$, there exists a proper utility process $V$ associated to $C$. Furthermore,\nfor a wide class of consumption streams $C$, the proper utility process $V$ is\nunique.

Key findings\ninclude: 1) short-selling restriction always reduces the investor's utility\nloss when model uncertainty is ignored; 2) the effect of consumption\nconstraints on utility loss is more delicate and relies on the investor's risk\naversion level.",

The resulting new class of risk measures, termed multi-asset return\nrisk measures (MARRMs), introduces a novel economic model for multiplicative\nrisk sharing. We analyze properties of these risk measures. In particular, we\nprove that a positively homogeneous MARRM is quasi-convex if and only if it is\nconvex. Furthermore, we provide conditions to avoid inconsistent risk\nevaluations. Then, we point out the connection between MARRMs and the\nwell-known concept of multi-asset risk measures (MARMs). This is used to obtain\nvarious dual representations of MARRMs. Moreover, we conduct a series of case\nstudies, in which we use typical continuous-time financial markets and\ndifferent notions of acceptability of losses to compare RRMs, MARMs, and MARRMs\nand draw conclusions about the cost of risk mitigation.",

Traditional risk measures typically operate on\nspaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random\nvariables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk\nmeasures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an\naxiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely\nadditive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded\nrandom variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the\nsupremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples\nillustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio\noptimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the\ntheory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a\nbroader range of financial and mathematical applications.",

The factor risk\nmeasure only depends on the joint distribution of the risk and the factors. A\nset of natural axioms are discussed, and particularly distortion, quantile,\nlinear and coherent factor risk measures are introduced and characterized.\nMoreover, we introduce a large set of concrete factor risk measures and many of\nthem are new to the literature, which are interpreted in the context of\nregulatory capital requirement. Finally, the distortion factor risk measures\nare applied in the risk-sharing problem and some numerical examples are\npresented to show the difference between the Value-at-Risk and the quantile\nfactor risk measures.",

          "abstract": "Constant product markets with concentrated liquidity (CL) are the most\npopular type of automated market makers. In this paper, we characterise the\ncontinuous-time wealth dynamics of strategic LPs who dynamically adjust their\nrange of liquidity provision in CL pools. Their wealth results from fee income,\nthe value of their holdings in the pool, and rebalancing costs. Next, we derive\na self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the\nwidth of the LP's liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the\npool (provision fees minus gas fees), the predictable losses (PL) of the LP's\nposition, and concentration risk. Concentration risk refers to the decrease in\nfee revenue if the marginal exchange rate (akin to the midprice in a limit\norder book) in the pool exits the LP's range of liquidity. When the drift in\nthe marginal rate is stochastic, we show how to optimally skew the range of\nliquidity to increase fee revenue and profit from the expected changes in the\nmarginal rate. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that, on average, LPs\nhave traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample\nperformance of our strategy is superior to the historical performance of LPs in\nthe pool we consider.",

We then argue that liquidity provision by\nmultiple liquidity providers can be understood as liquidity provision by a\nrepresentative liquidity provider, meaning that the analysis boils down to that\nfor a single liquidity provider.

The\nliquidity provider contributes to the liquidity pool by supplying assets to the\npool, and in return, they earn trading fees from investors who trade in the\npool. We propose a model of optimal liquidity provision in which a risk-averse\nliquidity provider decides the amount of wealth she would invest in the\ndecentralized market to provide liquidity in a two-asset pool, trade in a\ncentralized market, and consume in multiple periods. We derive the liquidity\nprovider's optimal strategy and the optimal design of the automated market\nmaker that maximizes the liquidity provider's utility. We find that the optimal\nunit trading fee increases in the volatility of the fundamental exchange rate\nof the two assets.
