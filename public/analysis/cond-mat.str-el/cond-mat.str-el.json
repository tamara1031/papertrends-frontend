Here we report signatures of Kitaev spin liquid physics in the honeycomb\nmagnet $Li_3Co_2SbO_6$, built of high-spin $\\it{d^7}$ ($Co^{2+}$) ions, in\ncontrast to the more typical low-spin $\\it{d^5}$ electron configurations in the\npresence of large spin-orbit coupling. Neutron powder diffraction measurements,\nheat capacity, and magnetization studies support the development of a\nlong-range antiferromagnetic order space group of $\\it{C_C}2/\\it{m}$, below\n$\\it{T_N}$ = 11 K at $\\it{\\mu_0H}$ = 0 T. The magnetic entropy recovered\nbetween $\\it{T}$ = 2 K and 50 K is estimated to be 0.6Rln2, in good agreement\nwith the value expected for systems close to a Kitaev quantum spin liquid\nstate. The temperature-dependent magnetic order parameter demonstrates a\n$\\beta$ value of 0.19(3), consistent with XY anisotropy and in-plane ordering,\nwith Ising-like interactions between layers. Further, we observe a spin-flop\ndriven crossover to ferromagnetic order with space group of $\\it{C}2/\\it{m}$\nunder an applied magnetic field of $\\it{\\mu_0H}$ $\\approx$ 0.7 T at $\\it{T}$ =\n2 K. Magnetic structure analysis demonstrates these magnetic states are\ncompeting at finite applied magnetic fields even below the spin-flop\ntransition. Both the $\\it{d^7}$ compass model, a quantitative comparison of the\nspecific heat of $Li_3Co_2SbO_6$, and related honeycomb cobaltates to the\nanisotropic Kitaev model further support proximity to a Kitaev spin liquid\nstate. This material demonstrates the rich playground of high-spin $\\it{d^7}$\nsystems for spin liquid candidates, and complements known $\\it{d^5}$ Ir- and\nRu-based materials.",

The\ntemperature versus magnetic-field phase diagram is established by the\nmagnetization, specific heat, and neutron-scattering measurements. Notably, the\nneutron diffraction spectra and the magnetization curve might provide\nmicroscopic evidence for a series of spin configuration for in-plane fields,\nwhich include the disordered spin liquid state, 120$^{o}$ antiferromagnet, and\none-half magnetization state. Furthermore, the ground state is suggested to be\na gapless spin liquid from inelastic neutron scattering, and the magnetic field\nadjusts the spin orbit coupling. Therefore, the strong spin-orbit coupling in\nthe frustrated quantum magnet substantially enriches low-energy spin physics.\nThis rare-earth family could offer a good platform for exploring the quantum\nspin liquid ground state and quantum magnetic transitions.",

          "abstract": "We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial\nwave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the\nsign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge\ncondition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function\nor trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method.\nFurthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through\nimportance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been\nsingle Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated\nforms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit\ncorrelations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often\nassumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a\nlarge class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of\nmulti-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater\ndeterminants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random\nwalkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC\nwith stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both\nquantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an\nefficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial\ncomputational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond\nstretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen\nin both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the\nmethod yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical\naccuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave\nfunctions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from\nmachine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.",

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the gold\nstandard classical algorithm for predicting these properties, but relies on\napproximations of the unknown universal functional, limiting its general\napplicability for many fundamental and technologically relevant systems. In\nthis work we develop a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm called quantum\nenhanced DFT (QEDFT) that systematically constructs quantum approximations of\nthe universal functional using data obtained from a quantum computer.\n  We benchmark the QEDFT algorithm on the Fermi-Hubbard model, both numerically\nand on data from experiments on real quantum hardware. We find that QEDFT\nsurpasses the quality of groundstate results obtained from Hartree-Fock DFT, as\nwell as from direct application of conventional quantum algorithms such as VQE.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that QEDFT works even when only noisy, low-depth\nquantum computation is available, by benchmarking the algorithm on data\nobtained from Google's quantum computer.\n  We further show how QEDFT also captures quintessential properties of strongly\ncorrelated Mott physics for large Fermi-Hubbard systems using functionals\ngenerated on much smaller system sizes. Our results indicate that QEDFT can be\napplied to realistic materials and molecular systems, and has the potential to\noutperform the direct application of either DFT or VQE alone, without the\nrequirement of large scale or fully fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

          "abstract": "Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of\nlarge, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to\ndetermine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such\na description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),\nwhich links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However,\ntendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and\nevolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found\nnumerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems\nat strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is\nwell-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what\nconditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the\nthermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system\nsize and evolution time?\n  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the\nstatus of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about\nthe dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts\ntowards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered\nmany-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and\npreventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related\nto tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in\nthe dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena\nimpede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover.\nNevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength\nsuggests the proximity of the MBL phase.

          "abstract": "Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an\nopen quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary\nevolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the\nlatter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.\nSeemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state\nhas spectral weight on the so-called quantum many-body scar states, which are\nnon-thermalizing eigenstates embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal\neigenstates. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence\nof quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems, particular to systems which\nexhibit scars-induced entanglement oscillations. We exemplify this with the PXP\nmodel and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of\nscarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to\nhave significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing\ninformation backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between\ntemporally-separated transient states of small subsystems, systematic\nsignatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it\nis seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced\n(diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. The retention of memory and revivals\nbetween transient subsystem states is a finer form of memory effect than\ncaptured by the revivals of full system's fidelity with the initial states.\nThis sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum\nscarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum\nscarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating\nfar-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.",

The theory is applied to quantum many-body\nscars, continuous, discrete and dissipative time crystals, Hilbert space\nfragmentation, lattice gauge theories, and disorder-free localization, among\nother cases. Novel pseudolocal classes of operators are introduced in the\nprocess: projected-local, which are local only for some states, crypto-local,\nwhose locality is not manifest in terms of any finite number of local densities\nand transient ones, that dictate finite-time relaxation dynamics. An immediate\ncorollary is proving saturation of the Mazur bound for the Drude weight. This\nproven theory is intuitively the rigorous algebraic counterpart of the weak\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis and has deep implications for\nthermodynamics: quantum many-body systems 'out-of-equilibrium' are actually\nalways in a time-dependent equilibrium state for any natural initial state. The\nwork opens the possibility of designing novel out-of-equilibrium phases, with\nthe newly identified scarring and fragmentation phase transitions being\nexamples.",

Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase\ndiagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN) used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the\nmicroscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating\ntungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG stabilizes\nsuperconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle\nvalue. For the smallest angle of $\\theta$ = 0.79$^\\circ$, we still observe\nclear superconducting signatures, despite the complete absence of the\ncorrelated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the dispersive and flat\nbands.

Among the most elusive phases of matter are quantum spin liquids,\nwhich have no long-range order even at zero temperature and host exotic\nfractionalized excitations with non-trivial statistics. These phases can occur\nin frustrated quantum magnets, such as the paradigmatic Heisenberg model with\nnearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions on the triangular\nlattice, the so-called $J_1-J_2$ model. In this work, we compute the spectral\nfunction using large scale matrix product state simulations across the three\ndifferent phases of this model's phase diagram, including a quantum spin liquid\nphase at intermediate $J_2/J_1$. Despite a plethora of theoretical and\nexperimental studies, the exact nature of this phase is still contested, with\nthe dominant candidates being a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, a gapless $U(1)$ Dirac,\nand a spinon Fermi surface quantum spin liquid state. We find a V-shaped\nspectrum near the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\Gamma$ point), a key\nsignature of a spinon Fermi surface, observed in prior neutron scattering\nexperiments. However, we find a small gap near the $\\Gamma$ point, ruling out\nsuch a phase. Furthermore, we find localized gapless excitations at the corner\nof the Brillouin zone boundary (K point) and the middle of the edge of the\nBrillouin zone boundary (M point), ruling out the gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin\nliquid phase. Our results imply that the intermediate spin liquid phase is a\ngapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid, and provide clear signatures to detect this\nphase in future neutron scattering experiments.",

          "abstract": "We theoretically propose a generation of an antiferro skyrmion crystal\n(AF-SkX) in a synthetic bilayer antiferromagnetic system under an external\nmagnetic field. By performing the simulated annealing for a spin model on a\ncentrosymmetric bilayer triangular lattice, we find that the interplay among\nthe layer-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the easy-plane\nsingle-ion anisotropy, the interlayer exchange interaction, and the in-plane\nmagnetic field leads to instability toward the AF-SkX. The obtained AF-SkX\nconsists of the skyrmion layer and anti-skyrmion layer with opposite skyrmion\nnumbers, which results in no skyrmion number as well as spin scalar chirality\nin the whole system. We also show that a ferri-type skyrmion crystal, where one\nof the layers has the skyrmion number of one and the other does not, appears\nwhen the magnitude of the magnetic field is varied. Our results provide a\nguideline to experimentally search for the AF-SkX in bulk and layered\nmaterials.",

          "abstract": "In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form\nsymmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such\nsymmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in\nmixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod\nout'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in\nlong-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries\nof a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics)\nare intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general\nprocedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby\nsymmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the\ninput state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove\nthat states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit\nlong-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their\ntopological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of\ntopological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to\nthe toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX\ndecoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically\nmixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between\nhigher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states\nin higher dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can\nalso give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct\nconcrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local\nquantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement,\nwhich manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the\ntopological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the\ngapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states\nrepresent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no\ncounterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form\nsymmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state\ntopological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as\nanother key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and\ncharacterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states\nare clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding\nstatistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth\nlocal quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further\ndemonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the\ndecohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises\nwhere decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.",

          "abstract": "Topological phases of matter offer a promising platform for quantum\ncomputation and quantum error correction. Nevertheless, unlike its counterpart\nin pure states, descriptions of topological order in mixed states remain\nrelatively under-explored. Our work give two definitions for replica\ntopological order in mixed states, which involve $n$ copies of density matrices\nof the mixed state. Our framework categorizes topological orders in mixed\nstates as either quantum, classical, or trivial, depending on the type of\ninformation that can be encoded. For the case of the toric code model in the\npresence of decoherence, we associate for each phase a quantum channel and\ndescribes the structure of the code space. We show that in the\nquantum-topological phase, there exists a postselection-based error correction\nprotocol that recovers the quantum information, while in the\nclassical-topological phase, the quantum information has decohere and cannot be\nfully recovered. We accomplish this by describing the mixed state as a\nprojected entangled pairs state (PEPS) and identifying the symmetry-protected\ntopological order of its boundary state to the bulk topology. We discuss the\nextent that our findings can be extrapolated to $n \\to 1$ limit.",
