We illustrate this approach on a system of three first-order\ndifferential equations arising in the theory of semi-classical orthogonal\npolynomials. We show that it can be restricted to a system of two first-order\ndifferential equations in two different ways on an invariant hypersurface. We\nbuild the space of initial conditions for each of these restricted systems and\nverify that they exhibit the Painlev\\'e property from a geometric perspective.\nUtilising the Painlev\\'e identification algorithm we also relate this system to\nthe Painlev\\'e VI equation and we build its global Hamiltonian structure.\nFinally, we prove that the autonomous limit of the original system is Liouville\nintegrable, and the level curves of its first integrals are elliptic curves,\nwhich leads us to conjecture that the 3D system itself also possesses the\nPainlev\\'e property without the need to restrict it to the invariant\nhypersurface.",

          "abstract": "Construction of superintegrable systems based on Lie algebras have been\nintroduced over the years. However, these approaches depend on explicit\nrealisations, for instance as a differential operators, of the underlying Lie\nalgebra. This is also the case for the construction of their related symmetry\nalgebra which take usually the form of a finitely generated quadratic algebra.\nThese algebras often display structure constants which depend on the central\nelements and in particular on the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we develop a new\napproach reexamining the case of the generic superintegrable systems on the\n2-sphere for which a symmetry algebra is known to be the Racah algebra $R(3)$.\nSuch a model is related to the 59 $2D$ superintegrable systems on conformally\nflat spaces and their 12 equivalence classes. We demonstrate that using further\npolynomials of degree 2,3 and 4 in the enveloping algebra of $su(3)$ one can\ngenerate an algebra based only on abstract commutation relations of $su(3)$ Lie\nalgebra without explicit constraints on the representations or realisations.\nThis construction relies on the maximal Abelian subalgebra, also called MASA,\nwhich are the Cartan generators and their commutant. We obtain a new\n6-dimensional cubic algebra where the structure constant are integer numbers\nwhich reduce from a quartic algebra for which the structure constant depend on\nthe Cartan generator and the Casimir invariant. We also present other form of\nthe symmetry algebra using the quadratic and cubic Casimir invariants of\n$su(3)$. It reduces as the known quadratic Racah algebra $R(3)$ only when using\nan explicit realization. This algebraic structure describe the symmetry of the\ngeneric superintegrable systems on the 2 sphere. We also present a contraction\nto another 6-dimensional cubic algebra which would corresponding to the\nsymmetry algebra of a Smorodinsky-Winternitz model.",

It is shown that the solution becomes a linear combination of\nmultiple DSGs in the distant past and future, with explicit formulae for the\nasymptotic phase shift for each DSG. Other generalizations of a single soliton\nare also discussed, such as $N$th-order solitons and soliton gases. We prove\nthat every $N$th-order soliton can be obtained by fusion of eigenvalues of\n$N$-soliton solutions, with proper rescalings of norming constants, and\ndemonstrate that soliton-gas solution can be considered as limits of\n$N$-soliton solutions as $N\\to+\\infty$.",

We consider the exact solution of\nthe model with periodic and open boundary conditions, and also derive multiple\ndescriptions of the exact thermodynamics of the model. We consider quantum\nquenches of different types. In one class of problems the dynamics can be\ntreated relatively easily: we compute an example for the real time dependence\nof a local observable. In another class of quenches the degeneracies of the\nmodel lead to the breakdown of equilibration, and we argue that they can lead\nto persistent oscillations.
