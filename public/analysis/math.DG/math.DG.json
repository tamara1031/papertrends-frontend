In a neighborhood of null infinity, in an appropriate\ncompactification of the spacetime to a manifold with corners, the wave\noperators are of edge type at null infinity and totally characteristic at\nspacelike and future timelike infinity. On a corresponding scale of Sobolev\nspaces, we demonstrate how microlocal regularity propagates across or into null\ninfinity via a sequence of radial sets. As an application, inspired by work of\nthe second author with Baskin and Wunsch, we prove regularity and decay\nestimates for forward solutions of wave type equations on asymptotically flat\nspacetimes which are asymptotically homogeneous with respect to scaling in the\nforward timelike cone and have an appropriate structure at null infinity.

Ideal data analysis tools\nfor such data sets should therefore account for such non-linear geometry. The\nRiemannian geometry setting can be suitable for a variety of reasons. First, it\ncomes with a rich structure to account for a wide range of geometries that can\nbe modelled after an energy landscape. Second, many standard data analysis\ntools initially developed for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised\nto data on a Riemannian manifold. In the context of protein dynamics, a\nconceptual challenge comes from the lack of a suitable smooth manifold and the\nlack of guidelines for constructing a smooth Riemannian structure based on an\nenergy landscape. In addition, computational feasibility in computing geodesics\nand related mappings poses a major challenge. This work considers these\nchallenges. The first part of the paper develops a novel local approximation\ntechnique for computing geodesics and related mappings on Riemannian manifolds\nin a computationally feasible manner. The second part constructs a smooth\nmanifold of point clouds modulo rigid body group actions and a Riemannian\nstructure that is based on an energy landscape for protein conformations. The\nresulting Riemannian geometry is tested on several data analysis tasks relevant\nfor protein dynamics data. It performs exceptionally well on coarse-grained\nmolecular dynamics simulated data. In particular, the geodesics with given\nstart- and end-points approximately recover corresponding molecular dynamics\ntrajectories for proteins that undergo relatively ordered transitions with\nmedium sized deformations.

          "abstract": "In this work we introduce a category $LDP_d$ of discrete-time dynamical\nsystems, that we call discrete Lagrange--D'Alembert--Poincar\\'e systems, and\nstudy some of its elementary properties. Examples of objects of $LDP_d$ are\nnonholonomic discrete mechanical systems as well as their lagrangian reductions\nand, also, discrete Lagrange-Poincar\\'e systems. We also introduce a notion of\nsymmetry group for objects of $LDP_d$ and a process of reduction when\nsymmetries are present. This reduction process extends the reduction process of\ndiscrete Lagrange--Poincar\\'e systems as well as the one defined for\nnonholonomic discrete mechanical systems. In addition, we prove that, under\nsome conditions, the two-stage reduction process (first by a closed and normal\nsubgroup of the symmetry group and, then, by the residual symmetry group)\nproduces a system that is isomorphic in $LDP_d$ to the system obtained by a\none-stage reduction by the full symmetry group.",
