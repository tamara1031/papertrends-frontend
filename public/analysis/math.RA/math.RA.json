Each block of $\\mathcal{O}$ has infinite simple objects. This\nresult is very different from that of $\\mathcal{O}$ for complex semisimple Lie\nalgebras. To find a connection between $\\mathcal{O}$ and the module category\nover some associative algebra, we define a subalgebra $H_1$ of\n$U(\\mathfrak{b})$. We give an exact functor from $\\mathcal{O}$ to the category\n$\\Omega$ of finite dimensional modules over $H_1$.

For an ($s$-)unital ring $R$,\nthe latter class exhausts all ideals of the ring. We prove that these\nconstructions behave well with respect to quotients. In order to study the\npassage to inductive limits, we introduce the classes of dense and left normal\nrings. We show that $\\mathrm{S}(R)$ is an abstract Cu-semigroup whenever $R$ is\nleft normal and, for such rings, the assignment $R\\mapsto \\mathrm{S}(R)$ is\ncontinuous.
