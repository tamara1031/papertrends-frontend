          "year": "2022-06",
          "abstract": "Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is crucial\nto assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical\nstudies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative\ntraits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimum phenotype, whose\nvalue is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population\nfate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the\nmoving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the\nsystem of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their\ninteractions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative\nmeasures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from\nthe entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its\nshape.We investigate two different models of reproduction (asexual and\ninfinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with general forms of selection.In\nparticular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away\nfrom the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse\nof the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our\nunified framework furthermore allows highlighting the underlying mechanisms\nthat lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities\nand discrepancies between the two reproduction models, the latter being\nultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the\nphenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population\ncrucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the sexual\ninfinitesimal model, in contrast with the asexual model.In the asexual model,\nwe also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels\nwith higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness,\nespecially in fast changing environments.",

          "abstract": "We introduce an individual-based model of a complex ecological community with\nrandom interactions. The model contains a large number of species, each with a\nfinite population of individuals, subject to discrete reproduction and death\nevents. The interaction coefficients determining the rates of these events is\nchosen from an ensemble of random matrices, and is kept fixed in time. The\nset-up is such that the model reduces to the known generalised Lotka-Volterra\nequations with random interaction coefficients in the limit of an infinite\npopulation for each species. Demographic noise in the individual-based model\nmeans that species which would survive in the Lotka-Volterra model can become\nextinct. These noise-driven extinctions are the focus of the paper. We find\nthat, for increasing complexity of interactions, ecological communities\ngenerally become less prone to extinctions induced by demographic noise. An\nexception are systems composed entirely of predator-prey pairs. These systems\nare known to be stable in deterministic Lotka-Volterra models with random\ninteractions, but, as we show, they are nevertheless particularly vulnerable to\nfluctuations.",

          "abstract": "The maintenance of diversity, the `commonness of rarity', and compositional\nturnover are ubiquitous features of species-rich communities. Through a\nstylized model, we consider how these features reflect the interplay between\nenvironmental stochasticity, intra- and interspecific competition, and\ndispersal. We show that, even when species have the same time-average fitness,\nfitness fluctuations tend to drive the community towards ever-growing\nunevenness and species extinctions, but self-limitation and/or dispersal allow\nhigh-diversity states to be sustained. We then analyze the species-abundance\ndistribution and the abundance distribution of individual species over time in\nsuch high-diversity states. Their shapes vary predictably along two axes --\nExclusion-Stabilization and Exclusion-Buffering -- that describe the relative\nstrength of the underlying ecological processes. Predicted shapes cover\ndifferent empirically observed cases, notably power-law and unimodal\ndistributions. An effective focal-species model allows us to relate static\nabundance distributions with turnover dynamics, also when species have\ndifferent mean fitness. The model suggests how community statistics and time\nseries of individual species can inform on the relative importance of the\necological processes that structure diversity.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The\nstate of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19\nhot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to\nimplement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal\nprecautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the\nCOVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a\nforecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from\nthe Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data\nfrom the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S.\nThe proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among\ncounty clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19.\nThe results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable\n(above 94\\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions\nsuch as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases\nat the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to\nslow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nis the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google\nCommunity Mobility Reports.",

          "abstract": "An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing\nfrom December 2019. As of July 22, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak\nwith more than 15 million confirmed infections and above 6 hundred thousand\nreported deaths worldwide. During this period of an epidemic when\nhuman-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control\nstrategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this\nstudy, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to\npredict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control\nreproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis\nof the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated\nthe proposed model to fit daily data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the\nsituation is still alarming. Our findings suggest that independent\nself-sustaining human-to-human spread ($R_0>1$, $R_c>1$) is already present.\nShort-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID-19 cases is\nwell captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management of\nquarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated\nindividuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are\navailable, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful\nin terms of reduction of cases.",

          "abstract": "To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world has\nvaccination, plasma therapy, herd immunity, and epidemiological interventions\nas few possible options. The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it\nmay take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and after\ndevelopment, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma\ntherapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight\nCOVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like\nIndia, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd\nimmunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19\ninfection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and\nwill result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions\n(complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing,\netc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread\nuntil the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR model\nwith intervention, which incorporates the epidemiological interventions in the\nclassical SIR model. To model the effect of the interventions, we have\nintroduced \\r{ho} as the intervention parameter. \\r{ho} is a cumulative\nquantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also discussed the\nsupervised machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate\n(\\b{eta}) for the SIR model with intervention from the prevalence of COVID-19\ndata in India and some states of India. To validate our model, we present a\ncomparison between the actual and model-predicted number of COVID-19 cases.\nUsing our model, we also present predicted numbers of active and recovered\nCOVID-19 cases till Sept 30, 2020, for entire India and some states of India\nand also estimate the 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted cases.",
