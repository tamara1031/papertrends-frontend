A bolt-on Cu plate 1.27 cm thick was used to thermally\nconnect the cavity equator to the second stage of a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler\nwith a nominal capacity of 2 W at 4.2 K.

The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with\nfrequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor\nas a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is\nsimilar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher\ntemperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface\nmodification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned\nwith the temperature and duration of heat treatment.

The energy stability of the beams produced by\nthat arrangement in the PWFA stage is comparable to both single-stage laser\naccelerators and plasma wakefield accelerators driven by conventional\naccelerators. Simulations support that the intrinsic insensitivity of PWFAs to\ndriver energy fluctuations can be exploited to overcome stability limitations\nof state-of-the-art laser wakefield accelerators when adding a PWFA stage.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the generation of electron bunches with energy\nspread and divergence superior to single-stage LW-FAs, resulting in bunches\nwith dense phase space and an angular-spectral charge density beyond the\ninitial drive beam parameters. These results unambiguously show that staged\nLWFA-PWFA can help to tailor the electron-beam quality for certain applications\nand to reduce the influence of fluctuating laser drivers on the electron-beam\nstability.

However, the characterization of intricate features within\n6-dimensional beam distributions using conventional diagnostic techniques\nnecessitates hundreds of measurements, using many hours of valuable beam time.\nNovel phase space reconstruction techniques are needed to substantially reduce\nthe number of measurements required to reconstruct detailed, high-dimensional\nbeam features in order to resolve complex beam phenomena, and as feedback in\nprecision beam shaping applications. In this study, we present a novel approach\nto reconstructing detailed 6-dimensional phase space distributions from\nexperimental measurements using generative machine learning and differentiable\nbeam dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that for a collection of synthetic\nbeam distribution test cases that this approach can be used to resolve\n6-dimensional phase space distributions using basic beam manipulations and as\nfew as 20 2-dimensional measurements of the beam profile, without the need for\nprior data collection or model training. We also demonstrate an application of\nthe reconstruction method in an experimental setting at the Argonne Wakefield\nAccelerator, where it is able to reconstruct the beam distribution and\naccurately predict previously unseen measurements 75x faster than previous\nmethods.",

In addition,\nthese inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these\nchanging conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide\nsufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before\nconstruction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite\ndifferent due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled.\nTherefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data\nsuccessfully are needed. We introduce an approach based on convolutional neural\nnetworks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings as inputs\nfor the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to\npredict scalar beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream,\ntaking into account the impact of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial\ntransverse laser distribution. We also introduce and evaluate a transfer\nlearning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation domain\nto the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying\nthis approach to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample\noutputs within a mean absolute percent error of 7.6%. This is a substantial\nimprovement over the model trained only on simulations, which has an error of\n112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector\nfrontend, these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector\nsystems could be easily adapted to other accelerator facilities.",
