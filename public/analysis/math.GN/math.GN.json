This\nprovides a $C_p$-version of the theorem of Lotz, Peck and Porta for Banach\nspaces $C(X)$ and $c_0$. Applications will be provided. We prove also a\n$C_p$-version of Rosenthal's theorem by showing that for an infinite compact\n$X$ the space $C_p(X)$ contains a closed copy of $c_{0}(\\Gamma)$ (with the\npointwise topology) for some uncountable set $\\Gamma$ if and only if $X$ admits\nan uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open subsets of $X$.

As an application of this characterization theorem we\nobtain the following results: 1) If $X$ is a \\v{C}ech-complete (in particular,\ncompact) space such that $C_p(X)$ is distinguished, then $X$ is scattered. 2)\nFor every separable compact space of the Isbell--Mr\\'owka type $X$, the space\n$C_p(X)$ is distinguished. 3) If $X$ is the compact space of ordinals\n$[0,\\omega_1]$, then $C_p(X)$ is not distinguished. We observe that the\nexistence of an uncountable separable metrizable space $X$ such that $C_p(X)$\nis distinguished, is independent of ZFC.
