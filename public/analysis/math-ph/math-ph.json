The\nadjoint and coadjoint modules are described, and the corresponding split\nversions of the adjoint and coadjoint representations up to homotopy of Lie\n$n$-algebroids are explained. The compatibility of a graded Poisson bracket\nwith the homological vector field on a $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold is shown to\nbe equivalent to an (anti-)morphism from the coadjoint module to the adjoint\nmodule, leading to an alternative characterisation of non-degeneracy of graded\nPoisson structures. The Weil algebra of a general $\\mathcal{Q}$-manifold is\ndefined and is computed explicitly in the case of Lie $n$-algebroids over a\nbase (smooth) manifold $M$ together with a choice of a splitting and linear\n$TM$-connections. In addition, we study linear structures on\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifolds, for which we see the connection with DG-modules\nand representations up to homotopy. In the world of split Lie $n$-algebroids,\nthis leads to the notion of VB-Lie $n$-algebroids. We prove that there is an\nequivalence between the category of VB-Lie $n$-algebroids over a Lie\n$n$-algebroid $\\underline{A}$ and the category of $(n+1)$-term representations\nup to homotopy of $\\underline{A}$, generalising thus a well-known result from\nthe theory of ordinary VB-algebroids.",

The flows under consideration\nare governed by the steady isothermal Euler equations for potential flow with\naxisymmetry so that the equations contain a singular geometric source term. We\nfirst formulate the shock stability problem as an initial-boundary value\nproblem with the leading conical shock-front as a free boundary, and then\nestablish the existence and asymptotic behavior of global entropy solutions of\nbounded variation (BV) of the problem. To achieve this, we first develop a\nmodified Glimm scheme to construct approximate solutions via self-similar\nsolutions as building blocks in order to incorporate with the geometric source\nterm. Then we introduce the Glimm-type functional, based on the local\ninteraction estimates between weak waves, the strong leading conical shock, and\nself-similar solutions, as well as the estimates of the center changes of the\nself-similar solutions. To make sure the decreasing of the Glimm-type\nfunctional, we choose appropriate weights by careful asymptotic analysis of the\nreflection coefficients in the interaction estimates, when the Mach number of\nthe incoming flow is sufficiently large. Finally, we establish the existence of\nglobal entropy solutions involving a strong leading conical shock-front,\nbesides weak waves, under the conditions that the Mach number of the incoming\nflow is sufficiently large and the weighted total variation of the slopes of\nthe generating curve of the Lipschitz perturbed cone is sufficiently small.\nFurthermore, the entropy solution is shown to approach asymptotically the\nself-similar solution that is determined by the incoming flow and the\nasymptotic tangent of the cone boundary at infinity.",

Back to\nthe original 2D Navier-Stokes equations, this implies an improved transition\nthreshold for the Taylor-Couette flow. The improvement is due to enhanced\ndissipation and new observations and constructions of weighted $L^2$ norms,\nwhich capture a hidden structure between the viscosity constant $\\nu$ and\n(different) rotating speeds and locations of two coaxial cylinders. In\nparticular, we allow the location of the outer cylinder to tend to infinity,\nwhich renders the initial fluid kinetic energy not uniformly bounded.

Geodesics in this random\ngeometry form an important class of random continuous curves exhibiting\nfluctuation theory quite different from that of Brownian motion. In this vein,\ncounterpart to Brownian local time, BLT (a self-similar measure supported on\nthe set of zeros of Brownian motion), a local time for geodesics, GLT, was\nrecently constructed and used to study fractal properties of the directed\nlandscape in (Ganguly-Zhang '22). It is a classical fact and can be proven\nusing the Markovian property of Brownian motion that the uniform discrete\nmeasure on the set of zeros of the simple random walk converges to BLT. In this\npaper, we prove the ''KPZ analog'' of this by showing that the local times for\ndiscrete geodesics in pre-limiting integrable last passage percolation models\nconverge to GLT under suitable scaling guided by KPZ exponents.\n  In absence of any Markovianity, our arguments rely on the recently proven\nconvergence of geodesics in pre-limiting models to that in the directed\nlandscape (Dauvergne-Virag '21). However, this input concerns macroscopic\nproperties and is too coarse to capture the microscopic information required\nfor local time analysis. To relate the macroscopic and microscopic behavior, a\nkey ingredient is an a priori smoothness estimate of the local time in the\ndiscrete model, proved relying on geometric ideas such as the coalescence of\ngeodesics as well as their stability under perturbations of boundary data.",

Very\nrecently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems\nand their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless,\nhow to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains\nto be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly\nsolvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the\nsymmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by\ncommuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point\nwavefunctions of each fSET phase.

We adopt the Wiener-Hopf method\nto compute the Green function for a cracked half plane, a background for the\nperturbed half plane. We rigorously show that the Green function asymptotically\nsatisfies a universal-direction SRC (uSRC) and radiates purely outgoing at\ninfinity. This helps to propose an implicit transparent boundary condition for\nthe scattered wave, by either a cylindrical incident wave due to a line source\nor a plane incident wave. Then, a well-posedness theory is established via an\nassociated variational formulation. The theory reveals that the scattered wave,\npost-subtracting a known wave field, satisfies the same uSRC so that its\nfar-field pattern is accessible theoretically. For a plane-wave incidence,\nasymptotic analysis shows that merely subtracting reflected plane waves, due to\nnon-uniform heights of the step-like surface at infinity, from the scattered\nwave in respective regions produces a discontinuous wave satisfying the uSRC as\nwell. Numerically, we adopt a previously developed perfectly-matched-layer\n(PML) boundary-integral-equation method to solve the problem.
