In contrast to the usual setting where the particle\nis instantaneously reset to a preferred location (say, the origin), here we\nconsider a finite time resetting process facilitated by an external linear\npotential $V(x)=\\lambda|x|~ (\\lambda>0)$. When resetting occurs, the trap is\nswitched on and the particle experiences a force $-\\partial_x V(x)$ which helps\nthe particle to return to the resetting location. The trap is switched off as\nsoon as the particle makes a first passage to the origin. Subsequently, the\nparticle resumes its free diffusion motion and the process keeps repeating. In\nthis set-up, the system attains a non-equilibrium steady state. We study the\nrelaxation to this steady state by analytically computing the position\ndistribution of the particle at all time and then analysing this distribution\nusing the spectral properties of the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator. As\nseen for the instantaneous resetting problem, we observe a `cone spreading'\nrelaxation with travelling fronts such that there is an inner core region\naround the resetting point that reaches the steady state, while the region\noutside the core still grows ballistically with time. In addition to the\nunusual relaxation phenomena, we compute the large deviation functions\nassociated to the corresponding probability density and find that the large\ndeviation functions describe a dynamical transition similar to what is seen\npreviously in case of instantaneous resetting. Notably, our method, based on\nspectral properties, complements the existing renewal formalism and reveals the\nintricate mathematical structure responsible for such relaxation phenomena. We\nverify our analytical results against extensive numerical simulations.",

In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped\nstochastic thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and\nanalyze the problem to minimize entropy production while driving the system\nbetween thermodynamic states in finite time. It is noted that entropy\nproduction in a fully isotropic temperature field, can be expressed as the\nWasserstein-2 length of the path traversed by the thermodynamic state of the\nsystem. In the presence of an anisotropic temperature field, the mechanism of\nentropy production is substantially more complicated as, besides dissipation,\nit entails seepage of energy between the ambient heat sources by way of the\nsystem dynamics. We show that, in this case, the entropy production can be\nexpressed as the solution of a suitably constrained and generalized Optimal\nMass Transport (OMT) problem. In contrast to the situation in standard OMT,\nentropy production may not be identically zero, even when the thermodynamic\nstate remains unchanged.

We study the analog of this timescale in many-body\nnon-Hermitian quantum chaos by a detailed analysis of long-range spectral\ncorrelators. For that purpose, we investigate the number variance and the\nspectral form factor of a non-Hermitian $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (nHSYK)\nmodel, which describes $N$ fermions in zero spatial dimensions. After an\nanalytical and numerical analysis of these spectral observables for\nnon-Hermitian random matrices, and a careful unfolding, we find good agreement\nwith the nHSYK model for $q > 2$ starting at a timescale that decreases sharply\nwith $q$. The source of deviation from universality, identified analytically,\nis ensemble fluctuations not related to the quantum dynamics. For fixed $q$ and\nlarge enough $N$, these fluctuations become dominant up until after the\nHeisenberg time, so that the spectral form factor is no longer useful for the\nstudy of quantum chaos. In all cases, our results point to a weakened or\nvanishing spectral rigidity that effectively delays the observation of full\nquantum ergodicity. We also show that the number variance displays\nnonstationary spectral correlations for both the nHSYK model and random\nmatrices. This nonstationarity, also not related to the quantum dynamics,\npoints to intrinsic limitations of these observables to describe the quantum\nchaotic motion. On the other hand, we introduce the local spectral form factor,\nwhich is shown to be stationary and not affected by collective fluctuations,\nand propose it as an effective diagnostic of non-Hermitian quantum chaos. For\n$q = 2$, we find saturation to Poisson statistics at a timescale of $\\log D$,\ncompared to a scale of $\\sqrt D$ for $ q>2$, with $D $ the total number of\nstates.",

In particular, recent results on two\nspecies ecosystems, for two competitors and for predator-prey, point that the\nspatial scale of population synchrony generally increases as the fluctuations\npropagates through the food web, i.e., the species more directly affected by\nenvironmental fluctuations presents the smaller spatial scale of population\nsynchrony. Here, we found that this behaviour is generally true for a two\nspecies ecosystem. The exception to this behaviour are the particular cases\nwhere the population fluctuations of one of the species does not damp by its\nown, but requires a strong transfer of the fluctuation to the other species to\nbe damped. These analytical results illustrate the importance of applying an\necosystem rather than a single-species perspective when developing sustainable\nharvestings or assessing the extinction risk of endangered species.",

We show that these two features generically emerge in the\nfluctuating phase of many-variable model ecosystems with disordered species\ninteractions, when species are supported by migration from outside the system\nat a small rate. We show that these and other phenomena can be understood\nthrough the existence of a scaling regime in the limit of small migration, in\nwhich large fluctuations and long timescales emerge. We construct an exact\nanalytical theory for this asymptotic regime, that provides scaling predictions\non timescales and abundance distributions that are verified exactly in\nsimulations. In this regime, a clear separation emerges between rare and\nabundant species at any given time, despite species moving back and forth\nbetween the rare and abundant subsets. The number of abundant species is found\nto lie strictly below a well-known stability bound, maintaining the system away\nfrom marginality. At the same time, other measures of diversity, which also\ninclude some of the rare species, go above this bound.\n  In the asymptotic limit where the migration rate goes to zero, trajectories\nof individual species abundances are described by non-Markovian jump-diffusion\nprocesses, which proceeds as follows: A rare species remains so for some time,\nthen experiences a jump in population sizes after which it becomes abundant (a\nspecies turnover event) and later sees its population size gradually decreasing\nagain until rare, due to the competition with other species. The asymmetry of\nabundance trajectories under time-reversal is maintained at small but finite\nmigration rate. These features may serve as fingerprints of endogenous\nfluctuations in highly-diverse ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "The composition of ecological communities varies not only between different\nlocations but also in time. Understanding the fundamental processes that drive\nspecies towards rarity or abundance is crucial to assessing ecosystem\nresilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In plankton\ncommunities in particular, large temporal fluctuations in species abundances\nhave been associated with chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, microbial\ndiversity is overwhelmingly sustained by a `rare biosphere' of species with\nvery low abundances. We consider here the possibility that interactions within\na species-rich community can relate both phenomena. We use a Lotka-Volterra\nmodel with weak immigration and strong, disordered, and mostly competitive\ninteractions between hundreds of species to bridge single-species temporal\nfluctuations and abundance distribution patterns. We highlight a generic\nchaotic regime where a few species at a time achieve dominance, but are\ncontinuously overturned by the invasion of formerly rare species. We derive a\nfocal-species model that captures the intermittent boom-and-bust dynamics that\nevery species undergoes. Although species cannot be treated as effectively\nuncorrelated in their abundances, the community's effect on a focal species can\nnonetheless be described by a time-correlated noise characterized by a few\neffective parameters that can be estimated from time series. The model predicts\na non-unitary exponent of the power-law abundance decay, which varies weakly\nwith ecological parameters, consistent with observation in marine protist\ncommunities. The chaotic turnover regime is thus poised to capture relevant\necological features of species-rich microbial communities.",

The resulting \"ballistic MFT\" (BMFT) is solely based on\nthe Euler hydrodynamics data of the many-body system. Within this framework,\nmesoscopic observables are classical random variables depending only on the\nfluctuating conserved densities, and Euler-scale fluctuations are obtained by\ndeterministically transporting thermodynamic fluctuations via the Euler\nhydrodynamics.
