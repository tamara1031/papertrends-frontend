The general dynamics introduced in\nthis paper, which we denote as \"parental\" active model (PAM), unifies two\nspecial cases commonly used to describe active matter, namely active Brownian\nparticles (ABPs) and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). We thereby\ndocument the existence of a deep and close stochastic relationship between\nthem, resulting in the subtle balance between fluctuations in the magnitude and\ndirection of the self-propulsion velocity. Besides illustrating the relation\nbetween these two common models, the PAM can generate additional offspring,\ninterpolating between ABP and AOUP dynamics, that could provide more suitable\nmodels for a large class of living and inanimate active matter systems,\npossessing characteristic distributions of their self-propulsion velocity. Our\ngeneral model is evaluated in the presence of a harmonic external confinement.\nFor this reference example, we present a two-state phase diagram which sheds\nlight on the transition in the shape of the positional density distribution,\nfrom a unimodal Gaussian for AOUPs to a Mexican-hat-like profile for ABPs.",

We employ a variant of the diffusing\ndiffusivity model where the equation of motion of the active particle involves\na time-dependent motility and diffusivities. Within our model, those\nfluctuations are coupled to each other. Using analytical methods, we obtain the\nprobability distribution function of particle displacement and its moments for\na single particle. We then investigate the impact of the environmental\nfluctuations on the collective behavior of the active Brownian particles by\nmeans of extensive numerical simulations. Our results show that the\nfluctuations hinder the motility-induced phase separation, accompanied by a\nsignificant change of the density dependence of particle velocities.

          "abstract": "As the study of active matter has developed into one of the most rapidly\ngrowing subfields of condensed matter physics, more and more kinds of physical\nsystems have been included in this framework. While the word 'active' is often\nthought of as referring to self-propelled particles, it is also applied to a\nlarge variety of other systems such as non-polar active nematics or certain\nparticles with non-reciprocal interactions. Developing novel forms of active\nmatter, as attempted, e.g., in the framework of quantum active matter, requires\na clear idea of what active matter is. Here, we critically discuss how the\nunderstanding of active matter has changed over time, what precisely a\ndefinition of 'active matter' can look like, and to what extent it is (still)\npossible to define active matter in a way that covers all systems that are\ncommonly understood as active matter while distinguishing them from other\ndriven systems. Moreover, we discuss the definition of an 'active field\ntheory', where 'active' is used as an attribute of a theoretical model rather\nthan of a physical system. We show that the usage of the term 'active' requires\nagreement on a coarse-grained viewpoint. We discuss the meaning of 'active'\nboth in general terms and via the specific examples of chemically driven\nparticles, ultrasound-driven particles, active nematics, particles with\nnon-reciprocal interactions, intracellular phase separation, and quantum active\nmatter.",

The\ntheoretical approaches proposed by Wenzel and later by Cassie and Baxter to\ndescribe the behaviour of a droplet of water on a rough solid were extensively\nused and improved to characterize the apparent contact angle of a droplet.\nHowever, the equilibrium hypothesis implied in these models means that they are\nnot always predictive of experimental contact angles due to strong\nmetastabilities typically occurring on heterogeneous surfaces. A predictive\nscheme for contact angle is thus urgently needed both to characterise a surface\nby contact angle measurements and to design superhydrophobic and oleophobic\nsurfaces with the desired properties, e.g., contact angle hysteresis. In this\nwork a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and the string method is employed\nto calculate the free energy profile of a liquid droplet deposited on a\npillared surface. For the analyzed surfaces, we show that there is only one\nminimum of the free energy that corresponds to the superhydrophobic wetting\nstate while the wet state can present multiple minima. Furthermore, when the\nsurface roughness decreases the amount of local minima observed in the free\nenergy profile increases.",

By measuring the contact angle and drop\nwidth simultaneously during droplet removal, we determine the changes in the\nshape of the drop as it depins and recedes. Our data indicate that there is a\nforce which opposes the motion of the contact line that depends both on the\namount of time that the drop has been in contact with the surface and on the\nwithdrawal rate. For water on silanized glass, we capture the experimentally\nobserved behavior with an overdamped dynamical model of contact-line motion in\nwhich the phenomenological drag coefficient and the assumed equilibrium contact\nangle are the only inputs. For other liquid/substrate pairs, the observed\ncontact-line motion suggests that a maximum static friction force is important\nin addition to damping. The dependence on time of contact and withdrawal rate,\nreminiscent of rate-and-state friction between solid surfaces, is qualitatively\nconsistent across three substrate-liquid pairs.",

Despite its significance to fundamental and applied\nprocesses, the contact lines at a junction of four-phases (two immiscible\nliquids, solid and gas) have been addressed only in a few investigations. Here,\nwe report an intriguing phenomenon that follows after the four phases of oil,\nwater, solid and gas make contact through the coalescence of two different\nthree-phase contact lines. We combine experimental study and theoretical\nanalysis to reveal and rationalize the dynamics exhibited upon the coalescence\nbetween the contact line of a micron-sized oil droplet and the receding contact\nline of a millimetre-sized water drop that covers the oil droplet on the\nsubstrate. We find that after the coalescence a four-phase contact line is\nformed for a brief period. However, this quadruple contact line is not stable,\nleading to a `droplet splitting' effect and eventual expulsion of the oil\ndroplet from the water drop. We then show that the interfacial tension between\nthe different phases and the viscosity of oil droplet dictate the splitting\ndynamics. More viscous oils display higher resistance to the extreme\ndeformations of the droplet induced by the instability of the quadruple contact\nline and no droplet expulsion is observed for such cases.",

The behavior of ions in the nanoconfinement\ncreated by the interfaces is probed by evaluating the ionic density profiles,\nnet charge densities, screening factors, and decay length associated with the\nscreening of the charged interface. Results show the presence of two distinct\nregimes of screening behavior as the concentration is changed from 0.1 M to 2.5\nM for a wide range of electrolyte systems generated by tuning the interfacial\nseparation, surface charge density, and ionic size. For low concentrations, the\nscreening factor exhibits a monotonic decay to 0 with a decay length that\ndecreases sharply with increasing concentration. For high concentrations\n($\\gtrsim 1$ M), the screening factor has a non-monotonic behavior signaling\ncharge inversion and formation of structured layers of ions near the\ninterfaces. The decay length under these conditions rises with increasing\nconcentration, exhibiting a power-law behavior. To complement the simulation\nresults, a variational approach is developed that produces charge densities\nwith characteristics consistent with those observed in simulations. The results\ndemonstrate the relation between the rise in the strength of steric\ncorrelations and the changes in the screening behavior.",

With this goal,\nmembranes based in nanoporous materials have been suggested in recent years.\nOne of the materials suggested is MoS$_2$, and classical Molecular Dynamics\n(MD) simulation is one of the most powerful tools to explore these\nnanomaterials. However, distinct Force Fields employed in MD simulations are\nparameterized based on distinct experimental quantities. In this paper, we\ncompare two models of salt that were build based on distinct properties of\nwater-salt mixtures. One model fits the hydration free energy and lattice\nproperties, the second fits the crystal density and the density and the\ndielectric constant of water and salt mixtures. To compare the models, MD\nsimulations for salty water flow through two nanopores sizes were used -- one\npore big enough to accommodate hydrated ions, and one smaller in which the ion\nhas to dehydrate to enter, and two rigid water models from the TIP4P family --\nthe TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/$\\epsilon$. Our results indicate that the water\npermeability and salt rejection by the membrane are more influenced by the salt\nmodel than by the water model, especially for the narrow pore. In fact,\ncompletely distinct mechanisms were observed, and they are related to the\ncharacteristics employed in the ion model parameterization.

The\ntheory has been verified with experiments and molecular dynamics data from the\ngramicidin A channel, L-type calcium channel, potassium channel, and\nsodium/calcium exchanger with real structures from the Protein Data Bank.

The\nenergy-absorbing capabilities of these architected materials can be enhanced\nfurther by incorporating viscoelastic material behavior into the buckling\nelements using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE). In addition to conventional\nviscoelastic behavior, LCEs also exhibit a highly dissipative rate-dependent\nsoft stress response from mesogen rotation under a mechanical load. However,\nthe buckling elements cannot take advantage of this dissipation mechanism\nbecause buckling occurs at strains below the threshold for mesogen rotation. In\nthis study, we investigate tension-induced soft stress behavior as an\nadditional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of lattice structures\ncomposed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs\nwith two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a\nnonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus/Standard as a\nuser-defined element to simulate finite-strain behavior of monodomain LCEs,\nincluding soft stress response. Simulations and experiments revealed a\nnon-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between\nhorizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable\nhorizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by\nbalancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending.

In this paper, we investigate the existence and key features\nof the ECE in anisotropic soft media, by using both theoretical analysis and\nfinite element (FE) simulations, and we apply the results to the non=invasive\nand non-destructive characterization of biological soft tissues. We also\ntheoretically study the characteristics of the shear waves induced in a\ndeformed hyperelastic anisotropic soft material by a source moving with high\nspeed, considering that contact between the ultrasound probe and the soft\ntissue may lead to finite deformation. On the basis of our theoretical analysis\nand numerical simulations, we propose an inverse approach to infer both the\nanisotropic and hyperelastic parameters of incompressible transversely\nisotropic (TI) soft materials. Finally, we investigate the properties of the\nsolutions to the inverse problem by deriving the condition numbers in\nanalytical form and performing numerical experiments. In Part II of the paper,\nboth ex vivo and in vivo experiments are conducted to demonstrate the\napplicability of the inverse method in practical use.",

For example, entangled blends of ring and linear\npolymers have been shown to exhibit enhanced shear thinning and viscosity, as\nwell as prolonged relaxation timescales, compared to pure solutions of rings or\nlinear chains. These emergent properties arise in part from the synergistic\nthreading of rings by linear polymers. Topology has also been shown to play an\nimportant role in composites of flexible (e.g., DNA) and stiff (e.g.,\nmicrotubules) polymers, whereby rings promote mixing while linear polymers\ninduce de-mixing and flocculation of stiff polymers, with these\ntopology-dependent interactions giving rise to highly distinct rheological\nsignatures.

A key\nreason for this knowledge gap is that many forces-including contraction forces\nfrom actomyosin networks, hydrostatic pressure from the cytosol, frictional\nforces from the substrate, and forces from adjacent cells-contribute to cell\ncluster movement, making it challenging to model, and ultimately elucidate, the\nfinal result of these forces. This paper describes a two-dimensional cell\nmembrane model that represents cells on a substrate with polygons and expresses\nvarious mechanical forces on the cell surface, keeping these forces balanced at\nall times by neglecting cell inertia. The model is discrete but equivalent to a\ncontinuous model if appropriate replacement rules for cell surface segments are\nchosen. When cells are given a polarity, expressed by a direction-dependent\nsurface tension reflecting the location dependence of contraction and adhesion\non a cell boundary, the cell surface begins to flow from front to rear as a\nresult of force balance. This flow produces unidirectional cell movement, not\nonly for a single cell but also for multiple cells in a cluster, with migration\nspeeds that coincide with analytical results from a continuous model. Further,\nif the direction of cell polarity is tilted with respect to the cluster center,\nsurface flow induces cell cluster rotation. The reason why this model moves\nwhile keeping force balance on cell surface (i.e., under no net forces from\noutside) is because of the implicit inflow and outflow of cell surface\ncomponents through the inside of the cell.",

To overcome this\nchallenge, we develop a predictive cellular vertex model that can delineate the\nrelative roles of substrate rigidity, tissue mechanics and active cell\nproperties on the movement of cell collectives. We apply the model to the\nspecific case of collective motion in cell aggregates as they spread into a\ntwo-dimensional cell monolayer adherent to a soft elastic matrix.

Our analysis reveals three key structural\nparameters defined by the morphology: The nucleation size and attachment order,\nwhich describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters\nnucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how\nthe growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this\ncharacterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly\nkinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us\nto identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a\nfunction of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the\nkinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that\ncould significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial\nself-assembly processes.",

Moreover, a simple argument\nallows us to predict the onset of CST, which for these very rough particles\noccurs at a critical volume fraction much lower than that previously reported\nin the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how mixtures of particles with\nopposing surface chemistry make it possible to finely tune the shear-thickening\nresponse of the suspension at a fixed volume fraction, paving the way for a\nfine control of the shear-thickening transition in engineering applications.",

          "abstract": "To elucidate the key factor for the quantitative prediction of the\nshear-thickening in suspensions in viscoelastic fluids, direct numerical\nsimulations of many-particle suspensions in a multi-mode Oldroyd-B fluid are\nperformed using the smoothed profile method. Suspension flow under simple shear\nflow is solved under periodic boundary conditions by using Lees--Edwards\nboundary conditions for particle dynamics and a time-dependent oblique\ncoordinate system that evolves with mean shear flow for fluid dynamics.\nSemi-dilute many-particle suspensions up to a particle volume fraction of 0.1\nare investigated. The presented numerical results regarding the bulk\nrheological properties of the shear-thickening behavior agree quantitatively\nwith recent experimental results of semi-dilute suspensions in a Boger fluid.\nThe presented result clarifies that an accurate estimation of the first normal\nstress difference of the matrix in the shear-rate range where the\nshear-thickening starts to occur is crucial for the quantitative prediction of\nthe suspension shear-thickening in a Boger fluid matrix at around the\nWeissenberg number $\\rm{Wi}=1$ by an Oldroyd-B model. Additionally, the effect\nof suspension microstructures on the suspension viscosity is examined. The\npaper concludes with a discussion on how the flow pattern and the elastic\nstress development change with the volume fraction and Weissenberg number.",
