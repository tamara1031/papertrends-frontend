The key idea is simple, i.e., we first transform each\ncomponent variable to standard normal via its marginal empirical distribution,\nand we then test for independence and conditional independence of the\ntransformed random vectors using appropriate $L_\\infty$-type test statistics.\nWhile we are testing some necessary conditions of the independence or the\nconditional independence, the new tests outperform the 13 frequently used\ntesting methods in a large scale simulation comparison. The advantage of the\nnew tests can be summarized as follows: (i) they do not require any moment\nconditions, (ii) they allow arbitrary dependence structures of the components\namong the random vectors, and (iii) they allow the dimensions of random vectors\ndiverge at the exponential rates of the sample size. The critical values of the\nproposed tests are determined by a computationally efficient multiplier\nbootstrap procedure. Theoretical analysis shows that the sizes of the proposed\ntests can be well controlled by the nominal significance level, and the\nproposed tests are also consistent under certain local alternatives. The finite\nsample performance of the new tests is illustrated via extensive simulation\nstudies and a real data application.",

Of interest is whether the\nprocedure could also be valid for testing the weak null hypothesis of zero\naverage treatment effect. Towards this end, we evaluate two general strategies\nfor FRT with covariate-adjusted test statistics: that based on the residuals\nfrom an outcome model with only the covariates, and that based on the output\nfrom an outcome model with both the treatment and the covariates. Based on\ntheory and simulation, we recommend using the ordinary least squares (OLS) fit\nof the observed outcome on the treatment, centered covariates, and their\ninteractions for covariate adjustment, and conducting FRT with the robust\n$t$-value of the treatment as the test statistic. The resulting FRT is\nfinite-sample exact for the strong null hypothesis, asymptotically valid for\nthe weak null hypothesis, and more powerful than the unadjusted analog under\nalternatives, all irrespective of whether the linear model is correctly\nspecified or not. We develop the theory for complete randomization, cluster\nrandomization, stratified randomization, and rerandomization, respectively, and\ngive a recommendation for the test procedure and test statistic under each\ndesign.

Overlap requires the existence\nof randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many\ntypes of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,\nobservational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known\nas Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the\nidentification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond\nunconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of\nstatistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is\nsufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this\ncondition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect\non the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as\nwell. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several\nwell-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove\nthat ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For\nexample, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the\nmodels proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression\nDiscontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).\nFor each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional\nassumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.\n  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic\ninsights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational\nstudies with complex treatment mechanisms.",

Among\nthose priors, Gaussian processes with a parametric Mat\\'ern covariance function\nis particularly notable in that its degree of smoothness can be determined by a\ndedicated smoothness parameter. \\citet{ma2022beyond} recently introduced a new\nfamily of covariance functions called the Confluent Hypergeometric (CH) class\nthat simultaneously possess two parameters: one controls the tail index of the\npolynomially decaying covariance function, and the other parameter controls the\ndegree of mean-squared smoothness analogous to the Mat\\'ern class.

For this purpose a new stochastic\norder is considered. In a second time, we study the case of functions of\nslightly dependent light-tailed random variables. We are able to recover the\nfamous McDiarmid type of concentration inequality for functions with the\nbounded difference property.

Recently, there has been a growing\nrealization that the assumption of uniform boundedness of the population\ncovariance matrices in the BST is not satisfied in some fields, such as\neconomics, where the variances of principal components may diverge as the\ndimension tends to infinity. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to eliminate this\nobstacle to applications of the BST. Our new CLT accommodates spiked\neigenvalues, which may either be bounded or tend to infinity. A distinguishing\nfeature of our result is that the variance in the new CLT is related to both\nspiked eigenvalues and bulk eigenvalues, with dominance being determined by the\ndivergence rate of the largest spiked eigenvalues.

Secondly, an applicant is typically not\ninterested in a marginal coverage guarantee which averages over all possible\n(but not available) training data sets, but rather in a guarantee conditional\non the specific training data. This work tackles these problems by, firstly,\nshowing that full conformal prediction sets are conditionally conservative\ngiven the training data if the conformity score is stochastically bounded and\nsatisfies a stability condition. Secondly, we propose an approximation for the\nfull conformal prediction set that has asymptotically the same training\nconditional coverage as full conformal prediction under the stability\nassumption derived before, and can be computed more easily.
