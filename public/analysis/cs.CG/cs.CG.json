We study this problem in\nthe form of a set cover problem for a given polygonal curve: find the smallest\nnumber $k$ of representative curves such that any point on the input curve is\ncontained in a subcurve that has Fr\\'echet distance at most a given $\\Delta$ to\na representative curve. We focus on the case where the representative curves\nare line segments and approach this NP-hard problem with classical techniques\nfrom the area of geometric set cover: we use a variant of the multiplicative\nweights update method which was first suggested by Br\\\"onniman and Goodrich for\nset cover instances with small VC-dimension. We obtain a\nbicriteria-approximation algorithm that computes a set of $O(k\\log(k))$ line\nsegments that cover a given polygonal curve of $n$ vertices under Fr\\'echet\ndistance at most $O(\\Delta)$. We show that the algorithm runs in\n$\\widetilde{O}(k^2 n + k n^3)$ time in expectation and uses $ \\widetilde{O}(k n\n+ n^3)$ space. For two dimensional input curves that are $c$-packed, we bound\nthe expected running time by $\\widetilde{O}(k^2 c^2 n)$ and the space by $\n\\widetilde{O}(kn + c^2 n)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^d$ the dependency on $n$ instead is\nquadratic. In addition, we present a variant of the algorithm that uses\nimplicit weight updates on the candidate set and thereby achieves near-linear\nrunning time in $n$ without any assumptions on the input curve, while keeping\nthe same approximation bounds. This comes at the expense of a small\n(polylogarithmic) dependency on the relative arclength.",

The task is to find a subfamily $\\mathcal{F}\n\\subseteq \\mathcal{D}$ of maximum cardinality that consists of pairwise\ndisjoint objects. This problem is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and is equivalent to the\nproblem of finding the maximum number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given\nfamily of polygons in the plane.\n  As shown by Adamaszek et al.

Nevertheless,\nto the best of our knowledge, in the polynomial-time regime only the trivial\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$-approximation is known for the problem in full generality.

The problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we\nconsider a line-constrained version in which all disks are centered on a line\n$L$ (while points of $P$ can be anywhere in the plane). We present an\n$O((m+n)\\log(m+n)+\\kappa\\log m)$ time algorithm for the problem, where $\\kappa$\nis the number of pairs of disks that intersect. Alternatively, we can also\nsolve the problem in $O(nm\\log(m+n))$ time. For the unit-disk case where all\ndisks have the same radius, the running time can be reduced to\n$O((n+m)\\log(m+n))$. In addition, we solve in $O((m+n)\\log(m+n))$ time the\n$L_{\\infty}$ and $L_1$ cases of the problem, in which the disks are squares and\ndiamonds, respectively. As a by-product, the 1D version of the problem where\nall points of $P$ are on $L$ and the disks are line segments on $L$ is also\nsolved in $O((m+n)\\log(m+n))$ time. We also show that the problem has an\n$\\Omega((m+n)\\log (m+n))$ time lower bound even for the 1D case.\n  We further demonstrate that our techniques can also be used to solve other\ngeometric coverage problems. For example, given in the plane a set $P$ of $n$\npoints and a set $S$ of $n$ weighted half-planes, we solve in $O(n^4\\log n)$\ntime the problem of finding a subset of half-planes to cover $P$ so that their\ntotal weight is minimized. This improves the previous best algorithm of\n$O(n^5)$ time by almost a linear factor. If all half-planes are lower ones,\nthen our algorithm runs in $O(n^2\\log n)$ time, which improves the previous\nbest algorithm of $O(n^4)$ time by almost a quadratic factor.",

          "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is an area of data science that focuses on\nusing invariants from algebraic topology to provide multiscale shape\ndescriptors for geometric data sets such as point clouds. One of the most\nimportant such descriptors is {\\em persistent homology}, which encodes the\nchange in shape as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the\nfeature scale. For many data sets, it is useful to simultaneously vary multiple\nfiltration parameters, for example feature scale and density. While the\ntheoretical properties of single parameter persistent homology are well\nunderstood, less is known about the multiparameter case. In particular, a\ncentral question is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent\nhomology by elements of a vector space for integration with standard machine\nlearning algorithms. Existing approaches to this problem either ignore most of\nthe multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are\nheuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise.
