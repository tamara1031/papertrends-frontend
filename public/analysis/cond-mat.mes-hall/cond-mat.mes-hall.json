In this work, we go beyond the\nknown description of the non-Hermitian topological phase by discovering a new\ntype of BBC that appears in generalized boundary conditions. The generalized\nBrillouin zone (GBZ) possesses non-trivial topological structures in the\nintermediate boundary condition between open and periodic boundary conditions.\nUnlike the conventional BBC, the topological phase transition is characterized\nby the generalized momentum touching of GBZ, which manifests as exceptional\npoints. As a realization of our proposal, we suggest the non-reciprocal\nKuramoto oscillator lattice, where the phase slips accompany the exceptional\npoints as a signature of such topological phase transition.

Here we show that line-gap topology and\npoint-gap topology can be intricately connected: topological line-gapped\nsystems in $d$ dimensions induce nontrivial point-gap topology on their\n$(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries when suitable internal and spatial symmetries\nare present. Since line-gapped systems essentially realize Hermitian\ntopological phases, this establishes a correspondence between Hermitian bulk\ntopology and intrinsic non-Hermitian boundary topology. For the correspondence\nto hold, no non-Hermitian perturbations are required in the bulk itself, so\nthat the bulk can be purely Hermitian. Concomitantly, the presence of\nnon-Hermitian perturbations in the bulk does not affect any results as long as\nthey do not close the bulk line gap. On the other hand, non-Hermitian\nperturbations are essential on the boundary to open a point gap. The\nnon-Hermitian boundary topology then further leads to higher-order skin modes,\nas well as chiral and helical hinge modes, that are protected by point gaps and\nhence unique to non-Hermitian systems. We identify all the internal symmetry\nclasses where bulk line-gap topology induces boundary point-gap topology as\nlong as an additional spatial symmetry is present, and establish the\ncorrespondence between their topological invariants. There also exist some\nsymmetry classes where the Hermitian edge states remain stable, in the sense\nthat even a point gap cannot open on the boundary.",

In trilayer graphene systems, interlayer couplings at the two\ninterfaces can possibly be tuned separately, and the competition between these\ninteractions can therefore influence the electronic structure in a significant\nway. In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted\nmonolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB) beyond the continuum model, using\nfirst-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We\nfind that at large twist angles, the electronic features of aAB are well\ndescribed by the interaction between the parabolic bands of the Bernal\nAB-bilayer and the Dirac bands of the twisted monolayer, resulting in a\nspontaneous electric polarization in the former that splits the parabolic\nbands. As the twist angle decreases, the coupling between adjacent layers at\nthe twisted interface becomes dominant, which makes aAB look like twisted\nbilayer graphene (TBG) interacting with the outer Bernal layer. A moir\\'e\npotential emerges in the TBG-like layers, leading to charge localization, while\nthe outer Bernal layer exhibits charge delocalization with substantial\nsublattice polarization at the atomic scale. Furthermore, we identify narrow\nbands with a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle of 1.16 degrees, closely\nmatching the magic angle of TBG.

Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has\npractical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle\nsuperlattices are slow and scale poorly.

It exhibits many abnormal properties\ncompared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the\norigin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural\ninformation on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the\nnanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical\nspectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the\nstructure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by\ncombining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS)\nbased on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in\ndiamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics\nand structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride\n(hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure\nthe confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2\nnm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the\nhydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile,\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on\nthe diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the\nmeasured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition\nobserved in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our\nresults showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of\nnanoconfined water in future applications.",

We focus on the\ndouble-Weyl semimetal as an illustrative example to show that the application\nof strain splits the higher winding number Weyl nodes and produces an\nanisotropic Fermi surface. Specifically, the Fermi surface of the double-Weyl\nsemimetal acquires nematic order. By extending chiral kinetic theory for such\nnematic fields, we determine the effective gauge fields acting on the system\nand show how strain induces anisotropy and affects the geometry of the\nsemi-classical phase space of the double-Weyl semimetal. Further, the\nstrain-induced deformation of the Weyl nodes results in transport signatures\nrelated to the covariant coupling of the strain tensor to the geometric tensor\nassociated with the Weyl nodes giving rise to strain-dependent dissipative\ncorrections to the longitudinal as well as the Hall conductance.

However, these\ntechniques have so far only been applied in amorphous materials, specifically\nsilicon nitride. Crystalline materials exhibit significantly lower intrinsic\ndamping at cryogenic temperatures, due to the absence of two level systems in\nthe bulk, as exploited in Weber bars and silicon optomechanical cavities.\nApplying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials\ncould therefore enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, due to the\ncombination of reduced internal friction, high intrinsic strain, and high yield\nstrength. Pioneering work has not yet fully exploited this potential. Here, we\ndemonstrate that single crystal strained silicon, a material developed for high\nmobility transistors, can be used to realize mechanical resonators with\nultralow dissipation. We observe that high aspect ratio ($>10^5$) strained\nsilicon nanostrings support MHz mechanical modes with quality factors exceeding\n$10^{10}$ at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported in silicon\nnitride.

However, most studies focused on single interfaces\nor superlattices, and the thermal transport across heterostructures formed by\nmultiple different materials is still mysterious. In this study, we demonstrate\nhow much the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second\ninterface, as well as how much the thermal conductivity of a material is\naffected by the nearby materials. Using Si and Ge modeled by classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are demonstrated. (1)\nThe existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the\noriginal interface. For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC\ncan be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K. This is because the nearby interface\nserves as a filter of phonon modes, which selectively allows particular modes\nto pass through and affect the TBC of the original interfaces. This impact will\ndisappear at the diffusive limit when the distance between interfaces is much\nlonger than the phonon mean free path so that phonon modes recover equilibrium\nstatistics before arriving at the second interface. (2) The thermal\nconductivity of a material can be significantly changed by the existence of\nneighboring materials. For example, a standalone 30-nm-thick Si's thermal\nconductivity can be increased from 50 to 280 W/mK, a more than 4-fold increase,\nbeating the bulk thermal conductivity of Si, after being sandwiched between two\nGe slabs.

In this\npaper, we present a Boltzmann transport equation study on high-temperature\nthermal conduction in bulk silicon by considering the effects of both phonons\nand electrons, and explore the role of the missing parts in the previous\nstudies on the thermal conductivity at elevated temperature. For the phonon\ntransport, four-phonon scattering is found to considerably reduce the thermal\nconductivity when the temperature is larger than 700 K, while the effects of\nphonon renormalization and thermal expansion on phononic thermal conductivity\nare negligible.
