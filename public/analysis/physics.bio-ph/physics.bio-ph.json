While cell-cell\ninteractions are clearly key determinants of collective cell migration -- in\naddition to individual cells self-propulsion -- the physical mechanisms that\ncontrol the emergence of cell clustering and collective cell migration are\nstill poorly understood. In particular, observations have shown that binary\ncell-cell collisions generally lead to anti-alignement of cell polarities and\nseparation of pairs -- a process called contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL),\nwhich is expected to disfavor the formation of large scale cell clusters with\ncoherent motion. Here, we adopt a joint experimental and theoretical approach\nto determine the large scale dynamics of cell assemblies from elementary\npairwise cell-cell interaction rules. We quantify experimentally binary\ncell-cell interactions and show that they can be captured by a minimal\nequilibrium-like pairwise asymmetric aligning interaction potential that\nreproduces the CIL phenomenology. We identify its symmetry class, build the\ncorresponding active hydrodynamic theory and show on general grounds that such\nasymmetric aligning interaction destroys large scale clustering and ordering,\nleading instead to a liquid-like microphase of cell clusters of finite size and\nshort lived polarity, or to a fully dispersed isotropic phase. Finally, this\nshows that CIL-like asymmetric interactions in cellular systems -- or general\nactive systems -- control cluster sizes and polarity, and can prevent large\nscale coarsening and long range polarity, except in the singular regime of\ndense confluent systems.",

Examples include living systems, such as assemblies of bacteria and\nbiological tissues, biopolymers driven by molecular motors, and suspensions of\nsynthetic self-propelled particles. A central question in the field is to\nunderstand and control the self-organization of active assemblies in space and\ntime. Most active systems exhibit either spatial order mediated by interactions\nthat coordinate the spatial structure and the motion of active agents or the\ntemporal synchronization of individual oscillatory dynamics. The simultaneous\ncontrol of spatial and temporal organization is more challenging and generally\nrequires complex interactions, such as reaction-diffusion hierarchies or\ngenetically engineered cellular circuits. Here, we report a novel and simple\nmeans to simultaneously control the spatial and temporal self-organization of\nbacterial active matter. By confining an active bacterial suspension and\nmanipulating a single macroscopic parameter, namely the viscoelasticity of the\nsuspending fluid, we have found that the bacterial fluid first self-organizes\nin space into a millimeter-scale rotating vortex; then displays temporal\norganization as the giant vortex switches its global chirality periodically\nwith tunable frequency, reminiscent of a torsional pendulum - a self-driven\none. Combining experiments with an active matter model, we explain this\nstriking behavior in terms of the interplay between active forcing and\nviscoelastic stress relaxation. Our findings advance the understanding of\nbacterial behavior in complex fluids, and demonstrate experimentally for the\nfirst time that rheological properties can be harnessed to control active\nmatter flows. Coupled with actuation, our tunable self-oscillating bacterial\nvortex may be used as a \"clock\" for locomotion of soft robots and microfluidic\npumping.",

          "abstract": "Coordinated and cooperative motion of cells is essential for embryonic\ndevelopment, tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion. A\npredictive understanding of the emergent mechanical behaviors in collective\ncell motion is challenging due to the complex interplay between cell-cell\ninteractions, cell-matrix adhesions and active cell behaviors. To overcome this\nchallenge, we develop a predictive cellular vertex model that can delineate the\nrelative roles of substrate rigidity, tissue mechanics and active cell\nproperties on the movement of cell collectives. We apply the model to the\nspecific case of collective motion in cell aggregates as they spread into a\ntwo-dimensional cell monolayer adherent to a soft elastic matrix. Consistent\nwith recent experiments, we find that substrate stiffness regulates the driving\nforces for the spreading of cellular monolayer, which can be pressure-driven or\ncrawling-based depending on substrate rigidity. On soft substrates, cell\nmonolayer spreading is driven by an active pressure due to the influx of cells\ncoming from the aggregate, whereas on stiff substrates, cell spreading is\ndriven primarily by active crawling forces. Our model predicts that cooperation\nof cell crawling and tissue pressure drives faster spreading, while the\nspreading rate is sensitive to the mechanical properties of the tissue. We find\nthat solid tissues spread faster on stiff substrates, with spreading rate\nincreasing with tissue tension. By contrast, the spreading of fluid tissues is\nindependent of substrate stiffness and is slower than solid tissues. We compare\nour theoretical results with experimental results on traction force generation\nand spreading kinetics of cell monolayers, and provide new predictions on the\nrole of tissue fluidity and substrate rigidity on collective cell motion.",

For\nhigher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed.

The frequency distributions can characterize the\npopulation-potential landscape related to the stability of ecological states.\nWe illustrate the practical utility of this approach by analyzing a\nforest-savanna model. Savanna, and Forest states coexist under certain\nconditions, consistent with past theoretical work and empirical observations.\nHowever, a new Grassland state, unseen in the corresponding deterministic\nmodel, emerges as an alternative quasi-stable state under fluctuations,\nproviding a novel theoretical basis for the appearance of widespread grasslands\nin some empirical analyses. The ecological dynamics are determined by both the\npopulation-potential landscape gradient and the steady-state probability flux.\nThe flux quantifies the net input/output to the ecological system and therefore\nthe degree of nonequilibriumness. Landscape and flux together determine the\ntransitions between stable states characterized by dominant paths and switching\nrates. The intrinsic potential landscape admits a Lyapunov function, which\nprovides a quantitative measure of global stability. We find that the average\nflux, entropy production rate, and free energy have significant changes near\nbifurcations under both finite and zero fluctuation. These may provide both\ndynamical and thermodynamic origins of the bifurcations. We identified the\nvariances in observed frequency time traces, fluctuations and time\nirreversibility as kinematic measures for bifurcations.

Due to\nthe assumed two-phase nature of blood and specific features of red blood cells\n(RBCs), mathematical models for blood flow in the microcirculation are highly\nnonlinear, coupling the flow and RBC concentrations (haematocrit). In contrast\nto previous works which accomplished blood-flow homogenisation by assuming that\nthe haematocrit level remains constant, here we allow for spatial heterogeneity\nin the haematocrit concentration and thus begin with a nonlinear microscale\nmodel. We simplify the analysis by considering the limit of small haematocrit\nheterogeneity which prevails when variations in haematocrit concentration\nbetween neighbouring vessels are small. Homogenisation results in a system of\ncoupled, nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow and\nhaematocrit transport at the macroscale, in which a nonlinear Darcy-type model\nrelates the flow and pressure gradient via a haematocrit-dependent permeability\ntensor. During the analysis we obtain further that haematocrit transport at the\nmacroscale is governed by a purely advective equation. Applying the theory to\nparticular examples of two- and three-dimensional geometries of periodic\nnetworks, we calculate the effective permeability tensor associated with blood\nflow in these vascular networks.

Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to\nquestion the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several\npredictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of\ntopological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains. More\nspecifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act\nas topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained\nbead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather\nstrong constraints on their binding sites: they must block the diffusion of the\nexcess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and,\nsimultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other\none. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition.\nFor example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA non-specifically,\nlike H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might\nalso explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why\nmultiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains.\nStrikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented,\nrelaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains.

The present work deals with the interplay of\nDNA-bridging proteins and globular macromolecular crowders, with the goal of\ndetermining the extent to which they collaborate in organizing the nucleoid. In\norder to answer this question, a coarse-grained model was developed and its\nproperties were investigated through Brownian dynamics simulations. These\nsimulations reveal that the radius of gyration of the DNA coil decreases\nlinearly with the effective volume ratio of globular crowders and the number of\nDNA bridges formed by nucleoid proteins in the whole range of physiological\nvalues. Moreover, simulations highlight the fact that the number of DNA bridges\nformed by nucleoid proteins depends crucially on their ability to\nself-associate (oligomerize). An explanation for this result is proposed in\nterms of the mean distance between DNA segments and the capacity of proteins to\nmaintain DNA--bridging in spite of the thermal fluctuations of the DNA network.\nFinally, simulations indicate that non-associating proteins preserve a high\nmobility inside the nucleoid while contributing to its compaction, leading to a\nDNA/protein complex which looks like a liquid droplet.

          "abstract": "Membrane curvature sensing is essential for a diverse range of biological\nprocesses. Recent experiments have revealed that a single nanometer-sized\nseptin protein can distinguish between membrane-coated glass beads of one\nmicron and three micron diameters, even though the septin is orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the beads. This sensing ability is especially surprising\nsince curvature-sensing proteins must deal with persistent thermal fluctuations\nof the membrane, leading to discrepancies between the bead's curvature and the\nlocal membrane curvature sensed instantaneously by a protein. Using continuum\nmodels of fluctuating membranes, we investigate whether it is feasible for a\nprotein acting as a perfect observer of the membrane to sense micron-scale\ncurvature either by measuring local membrane curvature or by using bilayer\nlipid densities as a proxy. To do this, we develop algorithms to simulate lipid\ndensity and membrane shape fluctuations. We derive physical limits to the\nsensing efficacy of a protein in terms of protein size, membrane thickness,\nmembrane bending modulus, membrane-substrate adhesion strength, and bead size.\nTo explain the experimental protein-bead association rates, we develop two\nclasses of predictive models: i) for proteins that maximally associate to a\npreferred curvature, and ii) for proteins with enhanced association rates above\na threshold curvature. We find that the experimentally observed sensing\nefficacy is close to the theoretical sensing limits imposed on a septin-sized\nprotein, and that the variance in membrane curvature fluctuations sensed by a\nprotein determines how sharply the association rate depends on the curvature of\nthe bead.",

However, particle-based simulations\nof lipid membranes are predominantly of flat lipid membranes because planar\nmembranes are easily connected over periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a\ncurved lipid membrane, one can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a\nbicelle (disk-like bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to\ncontrol curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic\npotentials, or ``tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations\ndue to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an\nalternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved\nlipid membrane with ``frozen'' equilibrated membrane patches. The method\npresented here is compatible with all particle-based lipid models and easily\nextended to many geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with\nDPPC, DOPC, DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3\ncoarse-grained model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts,\nprevents lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free\nmembrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes and\ndiscussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities (thickness, order\nparameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces asymmetric changes in\nlipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the coupled effect of curvature\nand membrane asymmetry in both number and lipid type. We report the resulting\nunique morphologies (inducing gel phase, faceting) and behaviors (thickness\ndependent on adjacent leaflet type) that are accessible with this method.",

By explicitly including\namino-acid residues surrounding these six pigments in our TDDFT calculations,\nwe systematically study the effect of the protein environment on energy and\ncharge-transfer excitations.

First, we show the omnipresent speed variability\nobserved in different species of live fish and artificial agents (RoboFish).\nBased on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia and rotational\nfriction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of\nindividuals on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We\ninvestigate how the interplay of variable speed and speed-dependent turning\naffects self-organized collective behavior by implementing an agent-based model\nwhich accounts for both effects. We show, that besides average speed, the\nindividual speed variability may have a dramatic impact on the emergent\ncollective dynamics, as two groups differing only in their speed variability,\nand being otherwise identical in all other behavioral parameters, can be in two\nfundamentally different stationary states. We find that the local coupling\nbetween group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the\norder-disorder transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in\npolarization with group size for groups of individuals with variable speed, and\na sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical group size (N=4 for\nVoronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all to\na distributed spatial interaction network.
