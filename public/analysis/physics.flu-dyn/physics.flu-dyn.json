In the present paper, three perspectives\nwhich are remaining challenges for applications of machine learning to fluid\ndynamics are considered: 1. interpretability of machine-learned results, 2.\nbulking out of training data, and 3. generalizability of neural networks. For\nthe interpretability, we first demonstrate two methods to observe the internal\nprocedure of neural networks, i.e., visualization of hidden layers and\napplication of gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), applied\nto canonical fluid flow estimation problems -- $(1)$ drag coefficient\nestimation of a cylinder wake and $(2)$ velocity estimation from particle\nimages. It is exemplified that both approaches can successfully tell us\nevidences of the great capability of machine learning-based estimations. We\nthen utilize some techniques to bulk out training data for super-resolution\nanalysis and temporal prediction for cylinder wake and NOAA sea surface\ntemperature data to demonstrate that sufficient training of neural networks\nwith limited amount of training data can be achieved for fluid flow problems.\nThe generalizability of machine learning model is also discussed by accounting\nfor the perspectives of inter/extrapolation of training data, considering\nsuper-resolution of wakes behind two parallel cylinders. We find that various\nflow patterns generated by complex interaction between two cylinders can be\nreconstructed well, even for the test configurations regarding the distance\nfactor. The present paper can be a significant step toward practical uses of\nneural networks for both laminar and turbulent flow problems.",

          "abstract": "Acquisition of large datasets for three-dimensional (3D) partial differential\nequations (PDE) is usually very expensive. Physics-informed neural operator\n(PINO) eliminates the high costs associated with generation of training\ndatasets, and shows great potential in a variety of partial differential\nequations. In this work, we employ physics-informed neural operator, encoding\nthe large-eddy simulation (LES) equations directly into the neural operator for\nsimulating three-dimensional incompressible turbulent flows. We develop the\nLESnets (Large-Eddy Simulation nets) by adding large-eddy simulation equations\nto two different data-driven models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO)\nand implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) without using label data. Notably,\nby leveraging only PDE constraints to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics,\nLESnets models retain the computational efficiency of data-driven approaches\nwhile obviating the necessity for data. Meanwhile, using LES equations as PDE\nconstraints makes it possible to efficiently predict complex turbulence at\ncoarse grids. We investigate the performance of the LESnets models with two\nstandard three-dimensional turbulent flows: decaying homogeneous isotropic\nturbulence and temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer. In the numerical\nexperiments, the LESnets models show similar accuracy as compared to\ntraditional large-eddy simulation and data-driven models including FNO and\nIFNO, and exhibits a robust generalization ability to unseen regime of flow\nfields. By integrating a single set of flow data, the LESnets models can\nautomatically learn the coefficient of the subgrid scale (SGS) model during the\ntraining of the neural operator. Moreover, the well-trained LESnets models are\nsignificantly faster than traditional LES, and exhibits comparable\ncomputational efficiency to the data-driven FNO and IFNO models.",

          "abstract": "We present a new turbulent data reconstruction method with supervised machine\nlearning techniques inspired by super resolution and inbetweening, which can\nrecover high-resolution turbulent flows from grossly coarse flow data in space\nand time. For the present machine learning based data reconstruction, we use\nthe downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale model based on a convolutional\nneural network to incorporate the multi-scale nature of fluid flows into its\nnetwork structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to a\ntwo-dimensional cylinder wake at $Re_D$ = 100. The reconstructed flow fields by\nthe proposed method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by\ndirect numerical simulation. Next, we examine the capability of the proposed\nmodel for a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The\nmachine-learned models can follow the decaying evolution from coarse input data\nin space and time, according to the assessment with the turbulence statistics.\nThe proposed concept is further investigated for a complex turbulent channel\nflow over a three-dimensional domain at $Re_{\\tau}$ =180. The present model can\nreconstruct high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space,\nand it can also reproduce the temporal evolution when the time interval is\nappropriately chosen. The dependence on the amount of training snapshots and\nduration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point\ncorrelation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and\nrobustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results\nsuggest that the present method can meet a range of flow reconstructions for\nsupporting computational and experimental efforts.",

The novel\nfeature of the proposed algorithm is the efficient reconstruction via\nderivative sharing between the inviscid and viscous schemes: highly accurate\nexplicit and implicit gradients are used for the solution reconstruction\nexpressed in terms of derivatives. The higher-order accurate gradients of the\nvelocity components are reused to compute the viscous fluxes for efficiency and\nsignificantly improve the solution and gradient quality, as demonstrated by\nseveral viscous-flow test cases. The viscous schemes are fourth-order accurate\nand carefully designed with a high-frequency damping property, which has been\nidentified as a critically important property for stable compressible-flow\nsimulations with shock waves [Chamarthi et al., JCP, 2022]. Shocks and material\ndiscontinuities are captured using a monotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme, which\nis also improved by reusing the gradients. For inviscid test cases, The\nproposed scheme is fourth-order for linear and second-order accurate for\nnon-linear problems. Several numerical results obtained for simulations of\ncomplex viscous flows are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness\nof the proposed methodology.",

          "abstract": "For the simulations of unsteady flow, the global time step becomes really\nsmall with a large variation of local cell size. In this paper, an implicit\nhigh-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) is developed to remove the restrictions on\nthe time step for unsteady simulations. In order to improve the efficiency and\nkeep the high-order accuracy, a two-stage third-order implicit time-accurate\ndiscretization is proposed. In each stage, an artificial steady solution is\nobtained for the implicit system with the pseudo-time iteration. In the\niteration, the classical implicit methods are adopted to solve the nonlinear\nsystem, including the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) and\ngeneralized minimum residual (GMRES) methods. To achieve the spatial accuracy,\nthe HGKSs with both non-compact and compact reconstructions are constructed.\nFor the non-compact scheme, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)\nreconstruction is used. For the compact one, the Hermite WENO (HWENO)\nreconstruction is adopted due to the updates of both cell-averaged flow\nvariables and their derivatives. The expected third-order temporal accuracy is\nachieved with the two-stage temporal discretization. For the smooth flow, only\na single artificial iteration is needed. For uniform meshes, the efficiency of\nthe current implicit method improves significantly in comparison with the\nexplicit one. For the flow with discontinuities, compared with the well-known\nCrank-Nicholson method, the spurious oscillations in the current schemes are\nwell suppressed. The increase of the artificial iteration steps introduces\nextra reconstructions associating with a reduction of the computational\nefficiency. Overall, the current implicit method leads to an improvement in\nefficiency over the explicit one in the cases with a large variation of mesh\nsize.",

Below a critical impact velocity, the air film remains intact; the\ndroplet rebounds off of the air film without making contact. Above this\ncritical impact velocity, the droplet always makes contact. The initiation of\ncontact formation occurs via a topological transition, whereby the initially\nconnected gas domain is ruptured, and a liquid capillary bridge forms, binding\nthe droplet to the surface. Here we probe this transition in detail around the\ncritical impact velocity using calibrated total internal reflection (TIR)\nmicroscopy to monitor the air film profile at high speed during the impact\nprocess. Two air film rupture modalities are observed: nucleated contacts,\nwhich are isolated and don't correspond to the global minimum air film\nthickness, and spontaneous contacts, that occur always on a ring centered upon\nthe impact axis where the air film reaches its global minimum.

We consider ratio of the wave speed $c$\nto wind friction velocity $u_*$ from $c/u_*=$ 2 to 8, i.e. in the slow to\nintermediate wave regime; and initial wave steepness $ak$ from 0.1 to 0.3; the\ntwo being varied independently. The turbulent wind and the travelling, nearly\nmonochromatic waves are fully coupled without any subgrid scale models. The\nnovel fully-coupled approach captures the simultaneous evolution of the wave\namplitude and shape, together with the underwater boundary layer (drift\ncurrent), up to wave breaking. The wave energy growth computed from the\ntime-dependent rms surface elevation is in quantitative agreement with that\ncomputed from the extracted surface pressure distribution, which confirms the\nleading role of the pressure forcing for finite amplitude gravity waves. The\nphase shift and the amplitude of the principal mode of surface pressure\ndistribution are systematically reported, to provide direct evidence for\npossible wind wave growth theories. For the momentum and energy fluxes, we find\nthat the wave form drag force is not a strong function of wave age but closely\nrelated to wave steepness. The time evolution of the rms steepness and the wave\nform drag suggests that there is an effect of the history of wind wave\ncoupling. The normalised wave growth rate we obtain agrees with previous\nexperimental and numerical studies.

          "abstract": "Infra-gravity waves are generally known as small-amplitude waves of periods\nbetween 25 seconds and 5 minutes. They originate from the presence of wave\ngroups in the open ocean waves and can move freely after being released near\nthe surf zone where they can be further fueled with energy from the spatially\nvarying break point of swell waves . As these waves approach the shore, the\nrelative importance of the infra-gravity wave signal increases, and its impact\non the shorter waves gets stronger. In addition, infra-gravity waves drive\nstrong cross-shore currents, which lead to significant back-and-forth motion of\nthe underlying sea water. This strong cross-shore motion has been made visible\nby recent field studies, where significant cross-shore movement was detected\nand found to be correlated with the infra-gravity wave signal. In the present\nwork, the connection between infra-gravity waves is explored further using\nlinear wave theory and an established numerical nearshore wave model (BOSZ). It\nis shown that in all cases, the presence of infra-gravity waves leads to strong\ncross-shore motion. This behavior can be understood by considering the\ninfra-gravity waves as separate free waves, and then following the fluid\nparticle trajectories excited by these waves. As it is shown, these\ntrajectories have a very large horizontal extent which -- if not separated from\nthe main gravity wave field -- appears as a large, but often not directly\nvisible back-and-forth motion, underlying the more readily observable gravity\nocean waves.",

The envelope of surface elevation and the\nvelocity potential on the free water surface are introduced in the framework,\nwhich are shown to be a new pair of canonical variables. Using the two\nenvelopes as the main unknowns, coupled envelope evolution equations (CEEEs)\nare derived based on a perturbation expansion. Similar to the High Order\nSpectral method, the CEEEs can be derived up to arbitrary order in wave\nsteepness. In contrast, they have a temporal scale as slow as the rate of\nchange of a wave spectrum and allow for the wave fields prescribed on a\ncomputational (spatial) domain with a much larger size and with spacing longer\nthan the characteristic wavelength at no expense of accuracy and numerical\nefficiency.

Suitable comparisons are made with the closest\ncanonical laminar flame configurations at same mixture conditions and their\nsuitability and limitations in expounding turbulent flame properties are\nelucidated. Since near zero-curvature surface locations are most probable and\nrepresentative of the average flame geometry in such large $Ka$ flames, this\nstudy focuses on the statistical variation of flame displacement speed and the\nconcomitant change in flame structure at those locations. Relevant flame\nproperties are averaged normal to the zero-curvature isotherm regions to obtain\nthe conditional mean flame structures. In the smallest $Le$ case, downstream of\nthe most probable zero-curvature regions, the temperature exceeds that of the\nstandard laminar flame, leading to enhanced local thermal gradient and flame\nspeed. This is due to increased heat-release rate contribution by differential\ndiffusion in positive curvatures downstream of the zero-curvature locations.\nFurthermore, locally, the flame structure is broadened for all cases due to a\nreversal in the direction of the flame speed gradient. This reversal is caused\nby cylindrical flame-flame interactions upstream of the zero-curvature regions,\nresulting in localized scalar mixing within the flame structure. These\nnon-local effects, in combination, define the mean flame structure and the\nassociated variation in local flame speed in turbulent premixed flames.",

The goal of\nROM-KF was to overcome low resolution and noise in experimental and uncertainty\nin CFD modeling of cardiovascular flows. The accuracy of the method was\nassessed with 1D Womersley flow, 2D idealized aneurysm, and 3D patient-specific\ncerebral aneurysm models. Synthetic experimental data were used to enable\ndirect quantification of errors using benchmark datasets. The accuracy of\nROM-KF in reconstructing near-wall hemodynamics was assessed by applying the\nmethod to problems where near-wall blood flow data were missing in the\nexperimental dataset. The ROM-KF method provided blood flow data that were more\naccurate than the computational and synthetic experimental datasets and\nimproved near-wall hemodynamics quantification.",

          "abstract": "Cardiac disease and clinical intervention may both lead to an increased risk\nfor thrombosis events due to modified blood flow in the heart, and thereby a\nchange in the mechanical stimuli of blood cells passing through the chambers of\nthe heart. Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced by the\nlevel and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the\nblood flow in the left ventricle of the heart through a computational model\nconstructed from patient-specific data. The blood flow in the ventricle is\nmodeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the mitral valve\nby a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A\nfinite element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation\nof the velocity and pressure of the blood flow is constructed. A triple\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then used to distinguish\nbetween rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear\nflow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally\ndifferent flow structures, each generating a distinct type of mechanical\nstimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare the results to simulations\nwhere a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a\nsignificant modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear\nin the simulation cases treated with clips increased more compared to the\nuntreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease in valve opening\narea of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain,\nbut a 150 % increase in shear. The computational analysis suggests a process\nfor patient-specific simulation of clinical interventions in the heart with a\ndetailed analysis of the resulting blood flow, which could support clinical\nrisk assessment with respect to platelet activation and thrombosis events.",

          "abstract": "In the COVID-19 pandemic, billions are wearing face masks, in both health\ncare settings and in public. Which type of mask we should wear in what\nsituation, is therefore important. There are three basic types: cotton,\nsurgical, and respirators (e.g. FFP2, N95 and similar). All are essentially air\nfilters worn on the face. Air filtration is relatively well understood,\nhowever, we have almost no direct evidence on the relative role played by\naerosol particles of differing sizes in disease transmission. But if the virus\nconcentration is assumed independent of aerosol particle size, then most virus\nwill be in particles > 1 $\\mu$m. We develop a model that predicts surgical\nmasks are effective at reducing the risk of airborne transmission because the\nfiltering material most surgical masks use is highly effective at filtering\nparticles with diameters > 1 $\\mu$m. However, surgical masks are significantly\nless effective than masks of FFP2, N95 and similar standards, mostly due to the\npoor fit of surgical masks. Earlier work found that ~30% of the air bypasses a\nsurgical mask and is not filtered. This highlights the fact that standards for\nsurgical masks do not specify how well the mask should fit, and so are not\nadequate for protection against COVID-19.",

To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the\nworld, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers.

However, wearing\nface covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer\nheat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in\ngyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and\nneed to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by\nthe fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward\nand outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen.\nApplying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material\nbased protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air\nacross the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging\nvirus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a\nconsequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study,\nshows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide\nboth inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus\ninfection like COVID-19.",

The\ncylinder in this subcritical flow regime has been extensively studied in the\nliterature and is considered a classic case of turbulent flow arising from a\nbluff body. The strategies presented are explored through the use of deep\nreinforcement learning. The cylinder is equipped with 10 independent\nzero-net-mass-flux jet pairs, distributed on the top and bottom surfaces, which\ndefine the AFC setup. The method is based on the coupling between a\ncomputational-fluid-dynamics solver and a multi-agent reinforcement-learning\n(MARL) framework using the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. This work\nintroduces a multi-stage training approach to expand the exploration space and\nenhance drag reduction stabilization. By accelerating training through the\nexploitation of local invariants with MARL, a drag reduction of approximately\n9% is achieved. The cooperative closed-loop strategy developed by the agents is\nsophisticated, as it utilizes a wide bandwidth of mass-flow-rate frequencies,\nwhich classical control methods are unable to match. Notably, the mass cost\nefficiency is demonstrated to be two orders of magnitude lower than that of\nclassical control methods reported in the literature.

In a recent study by Muramulla $et.al.^1$, a discontinuous\ndecrease of turbulence intensity is observed in a vertical particle-laden\nturbulent channel-flow for a critical volume fraction O($10^{-3}$). The\ncollapse of turbulent intensity is found out to be a result of catastrophic\nreduction of turbulent energy production rate. Mechanistically, particle-fluid\ncoupling in particle-laden turbulent Couette-flow differs from that in a closed\nchannel flow. In this article, the turbulence modulation in Couette-flow by\ninertial particles is explored through two-way coupled DNS where particle\nvolume fraction ($\\phi$) is varied from $1.75\\times10^{-4}$ to\n$1.05\\times10^{-3}$ and Reynolds Number based on half-channel width ($\\delta$)\nand wall velocity ($U$) ($Re_{\\delta}$) is $750$.

The drastic reduction of shear production of\nturbulence and in turn the reduction of viscous dissipation of turbulent\nkinetic energy are two important phenomena for the occurrence of discontinuous\ntransition similar to channelflow.

The theory is based on the exact phase-space\nequation for the Probability Density Function describing particle positions and\nvelocities. This allowed us to identify the distinct physical mechanisms\ngoverning the particle transport. We then examined the asymptotic behavior of\nthe particle motion near the wall, revealing the fundamental differences to the\nnear wall behavior that is produced when incorporating gravitational settling.\nWhen the average vertical particle mass flux is zero, the averaged vertical\nparticle velocity is zero away from the wall due to the particles\npreferentially sampling regions where the fluid velocity is positive, which\nbalances with the downward Stokes settling velocity. When the average mass flux\nis negative, the combined effects of turbulence and particle inertia lead to\naverage vertical particle velocities that can significantly exceed the Stokes\nsettling velocity, by as much as ten times. Sufficiently far from the wall, the\nenhanced vertical velocities are due to the preferential sweeping mechanism.\nHowever, as the particles approach the wall, the contribution from the\npreferential sweeping mechanism becomes small, and a downward contribution from\nthe turbophoretic velocity dominates the behavior. Close to the wall, the\nparticle concentration grows as a power-law, but the nature of this power law\ndepends on the particle Stokes number.
