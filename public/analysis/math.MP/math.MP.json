We define a\nhigher Courant-Dorfman algebra, and study the relationship with graded\nsymplectic geometry. In particular, we give graded Poisson algebras of degree\n$-n$ in the non-degenerate case. For higher Courant-Dorfman algebras coming\nfrom finite-dimensional vector bundles, they coincide with the algebras of\nfunctions of the associated differential-graded(dg) symplectic manifolds of\ndegree $n$.\n  We define a higher Lie conformal algebra and Poisson vertex algebra, and give\na higher (weak) Courant-Dorfman algebraic structure arising from them.\nMoreover, we prove that the higher Lie conformal algebras and higher Poisson\nvertex algebras have properties like Lie conformal algebras and Poisson vertex\nalgebras. As an example, we obtain an algebraic description of\nBatalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky(BFV) current algebras.",

It is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle over the space-time manifold, equipped\nwith a degree $1$ vector field and a compatible graded presymplectic structure.\nThis geometrical data naturally defines a Lagrangian gauge field theory.\nMoreover, it encodes not only the Lagrangian of the theory but also its\nfull-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation. In particular, the respective\nfield-antifield space arises as a symplectic quotient of the super-jet bundle\nof the initial fiber bundle. A remarkable property of this approach is that\namong the variety of presymplectic gauge PDEs encoding a given gauge theory we\ncan pick a minimal one that usually turns out to be finite-dimensional, and\nunique in a certain sense. The approach can be considered as an extension of\nthe familiar AKSZ construction to not necessarily topological and\ndiffeomorphism-invariant theories. We present a variety of examples including\n$p$-forms, chiral Yang-Mills theory, Holst gravity, and conformal gravity. We\nalso explain the explicit relation to the non-BV-BRST version of the formalism,\nwhich happens to be closely related to the covariant phase space and the\nmultisymplectic approaches.",

          "abstract": "We study the behavior of Donaldson's invariants of 4-manifolds based on the\nmoduli space of anti self-dual connections (instantons) in the perturbative\nfield theory setting where the underlying source manifold has boundary. It is\nwell-known that these invariants take values in the instanton Floer homology\ngroups of the boundary 3-manifold. Gluing formulae for these constructions lead\nto a functorial topological field theory description according to a system of\naxioms developed by Atiyah, which can be also regarded in the setting of\nperturbative quantum field theory, as it was shown by Witten, using a version\nof supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, known today as Donaldson-Witten theory.\nOne can actually formulate an AKSZ model which recovers this theory for a\ncertain gauge-fixing. We consider these constructions in a perturbative quantum\ngauge formalism for manifolds with boundary that is compatible with cutting and\ngluing, called the BV-BFV formalism, which was recently developed by Cattaneo,\nMnev and Reshetikhin. We prove that this theory satisfies a modified Quantum\nMaster Equation and extend the result to a global picture when perturbing\naround constant background fields. Additionally, we relate these constructions\nto Nekrasov's partition function by treating an equivariant version of\nDonaldson-Witten theory in the BV formalism. Moreover, we discuss the\nextension, as well as the relation, to higher gauge theory and enumerative\ngeometry methods, such as Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theory and recall\ntheir correspondence conjecture for general Calabi-Yau 3-folds. In particular,\nwe discuss the corresponding (relative) partition functions, defined as the\ngenerating function for the given invariants, and gluing phenomena.",

Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship\nbetween Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary\nstates. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic\nnon-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable\ntopological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the\nother hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of\ntopological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the\nthreefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the\nboundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this\nagreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence on the basis of $K$-theory.",

Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band\nnon-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type\npoint-gap topology present only for two bands.

We construct quantum theory\nstarting with any complex Banach space beyond a complex Hilbert space, through\nusing a basic fact that a complex Banach space always admits a semi-inner\nproduct. Precisely, in a complex Banach space $\\mathbb{X}$ with a given\nsemi-inner product, a pure state is defined by Lumer \\cite{Lumer1961} to be a\nbounded linear functional on the space of bounded operators determined by a\nnormalized element of $\\mathbb{X}$ under the semi-inner product, and then the\nstate space $\\mathcal{S} (\\mathbb{X})$ of the system is the weakly closed\nconvex set spanned by all pure states. Based on Lumer's notion of the state, we\nassociate a quantum system with a complex Banach space $\\mathbb{X}$ equipped\nwith a fixed semi-inner product, and then define a physical event at a quantum\nstate $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{X})$ to be a projection $P$ (bounded\noperator such that $P^2 =P$) in $\\mathbb{X}$ satisfying the positivity\ncondition $0 \\le \\omega (P) \\le 1,$ and a physical quantity at a quantum state\n$\\omega$ to be a spectral operator of scalar type with real spectrum so that\nthe associated spectral projections are all physical events at $\\omega.$ The\nBorn formula for measurement of a physical quantity is the natural pairing of\noperators with linear functionals satisfying the probability conservation law.\nA time evolution of the system is governed by a one-parameter group of\ninvertible spectral operators determined by a scalar type operator with the\nreal spectrum, which satisfies the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.
