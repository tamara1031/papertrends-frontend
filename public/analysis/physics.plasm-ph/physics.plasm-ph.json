          "year": "2023-07",
          "abstract": "We investigate the origin of mesoscale structures in the solar wind called\nmicrostreams defined as enhancements in solar wind speed and temperature that\nlast several hours. They were first clearly detected in Helios and Ulysses\nsolar wind data and are now omnipresent in the \"young\" solar wind measured by\nParker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter. These recent data reveal that\nmicrostreams transport a profusion of Alfv\\'enic perturbations in the form of\nvelocity spikes and magnetic switchbacks. In this study we use a very\nhigh-resolution 2.5 MHD model of the corona and the solar wind to simulate the\nemergence of magnetic bipoles interacting with the pre-existing ambient corona\nand the creation of jets that become microstreams propagating in the solar\nwind. Our high-resolution simulations reach sufficiently high Lundquist numbers\nto capture the tearing mode instability that develops in the reconnection\nregion and produces plasmo\\\"ids released with the jet into the solar wind. Our\ndomain runs from the lower corona to 20 Rs, this allows us to track the\nformation process of plasmo\\\"ids and their evolution into Alfv\\'enic velocity\nspikes. We obtain perturbed solar wind flows lasting several hours with\nvelocity spikes occurring at characteristic periodicities of about 19 minutes.\nWe retrieve several properties of microstreams measured in the pristine solar\nwind by Parker Solar Probe, namely an increase in wind velocity of about 100\nkm/s during the streams passage together with superposed velocity spikes of\nalso about 100 km/s released into the solar wind.",

          "abstract": "The physical processes in the solar corona that shape the solar wind remain\nan active research topic. Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma\nexchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar\nwind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma\nparameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of\nheavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a\nnew solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere,\ncapturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including\nneutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and\nionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and\ninto the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link\nits spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results\nconfirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key\nmechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic\nflux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant\nsolar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from\ncoronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces\nthe observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the\npredicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a\npopulation of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and\nsolar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.",

          "year": "2020-08",
          "abstract": "In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is\nbelieved to be a primary process during which explosive energy release and\nparticle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past\nyears have witnessed active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic\nmagnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much\nless explored issue is the consequence of 3D dynamics, where turbulent\nstructures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop.\nThis paper presents a series of 3D, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic\nturbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas with system\ndomains much larger than kinetic scales. Our simulations start from a\nforce-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength\nmagnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the\nreconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the\nreconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent\nstructures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics\nin RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects. The\nflux ropes evolve rapidly after their generation, and can be completely\ndisrupted due to the secondary kink instability. This turbulent evolution leads\nto superdiffusion behavior of magnetic field lines as seen in MHD studies of\nturbulent reconnection. Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and\nenergy-release time scale can be very fast and do not strongly depend on the\nturbulence amplitude. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like\nacceleration process supported by the motional electric field, whereas the\nnon-ideal electric field acceleration plays a subdominant role. We discuss\npossible observational implications of 3D RTMR in high-energy astrophysics.",

          "abstract": "The generation of compact, high-energy ion beams is one of the most promising\napplications of intense laser-matter interactions, but the control of the beam\nspectral quality remains an outstanding challenge. We show that in radiation\npressure acceleration of a thin solid target the onset of electron heating is\ndetermined by the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability at the front\nsurface and must be controlled to produce ion beams with high spectral quality\nin the light sail regime. The growth rate of the instability imposes an upper\nlimit on the laser pulse duration and intensity to achieve high spectral beam\nquality and we demonstrate that under this optimal regime, the maximum peak ion\nbeam energy per nucleon is independent of target density, composition, and\nlaser energy (transverse spot size). Our predictions are validated by two- and\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, which indicate that for recent\nand upcoming experimental facilities using ultrashort ($\\lesssim 25$ fs) laser\npulses it is possible to produce $100 - 300$ MeV proton beams with $\\sim 30\\%$\nenergy spread and high laser-to-proton energy conversion efficiency.",

Under proper conditions, electrons from the\nbackground plasma are trapped in the plasma wave and accelerated to\nultra-relativistic velocities. We present recent results from a\nproof-of-principle wakefield acceleration experiment that reveal a unique\nsynergy between a laser-driven and particle-driven accelerator: a high-charge\nlaser-wakefield accelerated electron bunch can drive its own wakefield while\nsimultaneously drawing energy from the laser pulse via direct laser\nacceleration. This process continues to accelerate electrons beyond the usual\ndecelerating phase of the wakefield, thus reaching much higher energies. We\nfind that the 10-centimeter-long nanoparticle-assisted wakefield accelerator\ncan generate 340 pC, 10.4+-0.6 GeV electron bunches with 3.4 GeV RMS convolved\nenergy spread and 0.9 mrad RMS divergence. It can also produce bunches with\nlower energy, a few percent energy spread, and a higher charge.

Leveraging the power\nof state-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPUs), we have made the\nchallenging integral task of PIC simulations achievable. Our proposed code\noffers several advantages by utilizing the integral method. Firstly, it offers\na natural solution for modeling non-neutral plasmas without the need for\npre-processing such as solving Poisson's equation. Secondly, it eliminates the\nrequirement for designing elaborate boundary layers to absorb fields and\nparticles. Thirdly, it maintains the stability of the plasma simulation\nregardless of the time step chosen. Lastly, it does not require strict\ncharge-conservation particle-to-grid apportionment techniques or electric field\ndivergence amendment algorithms, which are commonly used in finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD)-based PIC simulations. To validate the accuracy and\nadvantages of our code, we compared the evolutions of particles and fields in\ndifferent plasma systems simulated by three other codes. Our results\ndemonstrate that the combination of Jefimenko's equations and the PIC method\ncan produce accurate particle distributions and EM fields in open-boundary\nplasma systems. Additionally, our code is able to accomplish these computations\nwithin an acceptable execution time. This study highlights the effectiveness\nand efficiency of JefiPIC, showing its potential for advancing plasma\nsimulations.",

          "abstract": "The 3D quasi-static particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm is a very efficient\nmethod for modeling short-pulse laser or relativistic charged particle\nbeam-plasma interactions. In this algorithm, the plasma response to a\nnon-evolving laser or particle beam is calculated using Maxwell's equations\nbased on the quasi-static approximate equations that exclude radiation. The\nplasma fields are then used to advance the laser or beam forward using a large\ntime step. The algorithm is many orders of magnitude faster than a 3D fully\nexplicit relativistic electromagnetic PIC algorithm. It has been shown to be\ncapable to accurately model the evolution of lasers and particle beams in a\nvariety of scenarios. At the same time, an algorithm in which the fields,\ncurrents and Maxwell equations are decomposed into azimuthal harmonics has been\nshown to reduce the complexity of a 3D explicit PIC algorithm to that of a 2D\nalgorithm when the expansion is truncated while maintaining accuracy for\nproblems with near azimuthal symmetry. This hybrid algorithm uses a PIC\ndescription in r-z and a gridless description in $\\phi$. We describe a novel\nmethod that combines the quasi-static and hybrid PIC methods. This algorithm\nexpands the fields, charge and current density into azimuthal harmonics. A set\nof the quasi-static field equations are derived for each harmonic. The complex\namplitudes of the fields are then solved using the finite difference method.\nThe beam and plasma particles are advanced in Cartesian coordinates using the\ntotal fields.

Previous experiments reported DT fuel gain\nexceeding unity [O.A. Hurricane et al., Nature 506, 343 (2014)] and then\nexceeding the kinetic energy of the imploding fuel [S.

We report on recent experiments that have\nachieved record fusion neutron yields on NIF, greater than 100 kJ with\nmomentary fusion powers exceeding 1PW, and have for the first time entered the\nburning plasma regime where fusion alpha-heating of the fuel exceeds the energy\ndelivered to the fuel via compression. This was accomplished by increasing the\nsize of the high-density carbon (HDC) capsule, increasing energy coupling,\nwhile controlling symmetry and implosion design parameters. Two tactics were\nsuccessful in controlling the radiation flux symmetry and therefore the\nimplosion symmetry: transferring energy between laser cones via plasma waves,\nand changing the shape of the hohlraum. In conducting these experiments, we\ncontrolled for known sources of degradation.

Combining the Lie-Poisson structure with a\nconstruction due to Scovel-Weinstein, we develop a theory of smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrostatics (SPMHS).

The axisymmetric\nCasimir invariants are used, along with the Hamiltonian functional to apply the\nenergy-Casimir variational principle for axisymmetric two-fluid plasmas with\nincompressible ion flows.

Even though a few such\nthrusters are currently undergoing their late-stage development campaigns, many\nunanswered questions yet exist concerning the behavior and evolution of the\nplasma in these large-size thrusters that feature an unconventional magnetic\nfield topology. Noting the complex, multi-dimensional nature of plasma\nprocesses in Hall thrusters, high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations are\noptimal tools to study the intricate plasma behavior. Nonetheless, the\nsignificant computational cost of traditional PIC schemes renders simulating\nhigh-power thrusters without any physics-altering speed-up factors unfeasible.\nThus, in this article, we demonstrate the applicability of the novel\nreduced-order PIC scheme for a cost-efficient, self-consistent study of the\nhigh-power Hall thrusters by performing simulations of a 20 kW magnetically\nshielded Hall thruster along the axial-azimuthal and radial-azimuthal\ncoordinates. The axial-azimuthal simulations are performed for three operating\nconditions in a rather simplified representation of the thruster's inherently\n3D configuration. Nevertheless, we resolved self-consistently an unprecedented\n650 us of the discharge evolution without any ad-hoc electron mobility model,\ncapturing several breathing cycles and approximating the experimental\nperformance parameters with an accuracy of 70 to 80 % across the operating\nconditions. The radial-azimuthal simulations casted further light on the\nevolution of the azimuthal instabilities and the resulting variations in the\nelectrons' cross-field mobility and the plasma-wall interactions. Particularly,\nwe observed the development of a long-wavelength, relatively low-frequency wave\nmode near the exit plane of the thruster's channel that induces a notable\nelectron transport.",

          "abstract": "Today, partially magnetized low-temperature plasmas (LTP) in an ExB\nconfiguration, where the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the\nself-consistent electric field, have important industrial applications. Hall\nthrusters, a type of electrostatic plasma propulsion, are one of the main LTP\ntechnologies whose advancement is hindered by the not-fully-understood\nunderlying physics of operation, particularly, with respect to the plasma\ninstabilities and the associated electron cross-field transport. The\ndevelopment of Hall thrusters with unconventional magnetic field topologies has\nimposed further questions regarding the instabilities' characteristics and the\nelectrons' dynamics in these modern cross-field configurations. Accordingly, we\npresent in this effort a series of studies on the influence of four factors on\nthe plasma processes in the radial-azimuthal coordinates of a Hall thruster,\nnamely, the magnetic field gradient, Secondary Electron Emission,\nelectron-neutral collisions, and plasma number density. The studies are carried\nout using the reduced-order particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed by the\nauthors. The setup of the radial-azimuthal simulations largely follows a\nwell-defined benchmark case from the literature in which the magnetic field is\noriented along the radius and a constant axial electric field is applied\nperpendicular to the simulation plane. The salient finding from our\ninvestigations is that, in the studied cases corresponding to elevated plasma\ndensities, an inverse energy cascade leads to the formation of a\nlong-wavelength, high-frequency azimuthal mode. Moreover, in the presence of\nstrong magnetic field gradients, this mode is fully developed and induces a\nsignificant electron cross-field transport as well as a notable heating of the\nion population.",
