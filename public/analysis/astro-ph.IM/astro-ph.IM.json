          "year": "2021-06",
          "abstract": "Simulations of exoplanet albedo profiles are key to planning and interpreting\nfuture direct imaging observations. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the\nPlanetary Spectrum Generator to produce simulations of reflected light\nexoplanet spectra. We use PSG to examine multiple issues relevant to all models\nof directly imaged exoplanet spectra and to produce sample spectra of the\nbright, nearby exoplanet $\\upsilon$ Andromedae d, a potential direct imaging\ntarget for next-generation facilities. We introduce a new, fast, and accurate\nsubsampling technique that enables calculations of disk-integrated spectra one\norder of magnitude faster than Chebyshev-Gauss sampling for moderate- to\nhigh-resolution sampling. Using this method and a first-principles-derived\natmosphere for $\\upsilon$ And d, we simulate phase-dependent spectra for a\nvariety of different potential atmospheric configurations. The simulated\nspectra for $\\upsilon$ And d include versions with different haze and cloud\nproperties. Based on our combined analysis of this planet's orbital parameters,\nphase-and illumination-appropriate model spectra, and realistic instrument\nnoise parameters, we find that $\\upsilon$ And d is a potentially favorable\ndirect imaging and spectroscopy target for the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on\nthe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. When a noise model corresponding to the\nRoman CGI SPC spectroscopy mode is included, PSG predicts the time required to\nreach a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 of the simulated spectra in both the\ncentral wavelength bin of the Roman CGI SPC spectroscopy mode (R=50 spectrum)\nand of the Band 1 HLC imaging mode is approximately 400 and less than 40 hr,\nrespectively. We also discuss potential pathways to extricating information\nabout the planet and its atmosphere with future observations and find that\nRoman observations may be able to bound the interior temperature of the planet.",

          "year": "2020-07",
          "abstract": "Precision radial velocity (RV) measurements in the near-infrared are a\npowerful tool to detect and characterize exoplanets around low-mass stars or\nyoung stars with higher magnetic activity. However, the presence of strong\ntelluric absorption lines and emission lines in the near infrared that\nsignificantly vary in time can prevent extraction of RV information from these\nspectra by classical techniques, which ignore or mask the telluric lines. We\npresent a methodology and pipeline to derive precision RVs from near-infrared\nspectra using a forward-modeling technique. We applied this to spectra with a\nwide wavelength coverage (Y, J, and H bands, simultaneously), taken by the\nInfraRed Doppler (IRD) spectrograph on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope. Our pipeline\nextracts the instantaneous instrumental profile of the spectrograph for each\nspectral segment, based on a reference spectrum of the laser-frequency comb\nthat is injected into the spectrograph simultaneously with the stellar light.\nThese profiles are used to derive the intrinsic stellar template spectrum,\nwhich is free from instrumental broadening and telluric features, as well as\nmodel and fit individual observed spectra in the RV analysis. Implementing a\nseries of numerical simulations using theoretical spectra that mimic IRD data,\nwe test the pipeline and show that IRD can achieve $<2$ m s$^{-1}$ precision\nfor slowly rotating mid-to-late M dwarfs with a signal-to-noise ratio $> 100$\nper pixel at 1000 nm. Dependences of RV precision on various stellar parameters\n(e.g., $T_{\\rm eff}$, $v\\sin i$, [Fe/H]) and the impact of telluric-line\nblendings on the RV accuracy are discussed through the mock spectra analyses.\nWe also apply the RV-analysis pipeline to the observed spectra of GJ 699 and\nTRAPPIST-1, demonstrating that the spectrograph and the pipeline are capable of\nan RV accuracy of $<3$ m s$^{-1}$ at least on a time scale of a few months.",

          "year": "2021-09",
          "abstract": "Aims. The catalog of Stars With ExoplanETs (SWEET-Cat) was originally\nintroduced in 2013. Since then many more exoplanets have been confirmed,\nincreasing significantly the number of host stars listed there. A crucial step\ntoward a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and\nhomogeneous characterization of their host stars. Better spectroscopic stellar\nparameters along with new results from Gaia eDR3 provide updated and precise\nparameters for the discovered planets. A new version of the catalog, whose\nhomogeneity in the derivation of the parameters is key to unraveling\nstar-planet connections, is available to the community. Methods. We made use of\nhigh-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or\ncollected through public archives. The spectroscopic stellar parameters were\nderived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES and\nMOOG (ARES+MOOG) as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. We re-derived\nparameters for the stars in the catalog using better quality spectra and/or\nusing the most recent versions of the codes. Moreover, the new SWEET-Cat table\ncan now be more easily combined with the planet properties listed both at the\nExtrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive to perform\nstatistical analyses of exoplanets. We also made use of the recent GAIA eDR3\nparallaxes and respective photometry to derive consistent and accurate surface\ngravity values for the host stars. Results. We increased the number of stars\nwith homogeneous parameters by more than 40\\% (from 645 to 928). We reviewed\nand updated the metallicity distributions of stars hosting planets with\ndifferent mass regimes comparing the low-mass planets (< 30M$_{\\oplus}$) with\nthe high-mass planets. The new data strengthen previous results showing the\npossible trend in the metallicity-period-mass diagram for low-mass planets.",

Observations of extensive air showers by\nthe Observatory can be used to probe hadronic interactions at high energy, in a\nkinematic and energy region inaccessible to experiments at man-made\naccelerators and to measure the muon component of the shower. Air showers\ninduced by different primaries have different muon contents. With increasing\nmass of the primary cosmic ray particle, it is expected that the muon content\nin the corresponding air showers should also increase. Recent results obtained\nfrom the Pierre Auger Observatory and other experiments indicate that all the\nshower simulations underestimate the number of muons in the showers compared to\nthe data. This is the so-called muon deficit. In this paper we briefly review\nthe muon measurements, and present in more detail recent results on\nfluctuations in the muon number. These results provide new insights into the\norigin of the muon deficit in air shower simulations and constrain the models\nof hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies. With the current design of the\nsurface detectors it is also difficult to reliably separate the contributions\nof muons to the SD signal from the contributions of photons, electrons, and\npositrons. Therefore, we also present a new method to extract the muon\ncomponent of the signal time traces recorded by each SD station using recurrent\nneural networks. The combination of such algorithms, with the future data\ncollected by the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory, will be a major step\nforward, as we are likely to achieve an unprecedented resolution in mass\nestimation on an event-by-event basis.",

Magnetohydrodynamic dynamo models and empirically observed\nrelationships have established that the polar field is the primary determinant\nof the future solar cycle amplitude. Models of solar surface evolution of\ntilted active regions indicate that the mid to high latitude surges of magnetic\nflux govern dynamics leading to the reversal and build-up of polar fields. Our\ntheoretical understanding and numerical models of this high latitude magnetic\nfield dynamics and plasma flows - that are a critical component of the sunspot\ncycle - lack precise observational constraints. This limitation compromises our\nability to observe the enigmatic kilo Gauss polar flux patches and constrain\nthe polar field distribution at high latitudes. The lack of these observations\nhandicap our understanding of how high latitude magnetic fields power polar\njets, plumes, and the fast solar wind that extend to the boundaries of the\nheliosphere and modulate solar open flux and cosmic ray flux within the solar\nsystem. Accurate observation of the Sun's polar regions, therefore, is the\nsingle most outstanding challenge that confronts Heliophysics.

Although originally discovered at GHz\nfrequencies, most FRBs have been detected between 400 to 800 MHz. Nevertheless,\nonly a handful of FRBs were detected below 400 MHz. Searching for FRBs at low\nfrequencies is computationally challenging due to increased dispersive delay\nthat must be accounted for. However, the wide field of view (FoV) of\nlow-frequency telescopes - such as the the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and\nprototype stations of the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) -\nmakes them promising instruments to open a low-frequency window on FRB event\nrates, and constrain FRB emission models. The standard approach, inherited from\nhigh-frequencies, is to form multiple tied-array beams to tessellate the entire\nFoV and perform the search on the resulting time series. This approach,\nhowever, may not be optimal for low-frequency interferometers due to their\nlarge FoVs and high spatial resolutions leading to a large number of beams.\nConsequently, there are regions of parameter space in terms of number of\nantennas and resolution elements (pixels) where interferometric imaging is\ncomputationally more efficient.

In many cases, fast mitigation of strong radio\nfrequency interference (RFI) is valuable for studying short lived radio\ntransients so that the astronomers can perform detailed observations of\ncelestial radio sources. The standard method to manually excise contaminated\nblocks in time and frequency makes the removed data useless for radio astronomy\nanalyses. This motivates the need for better radio frequency interference (RFI)\nmitigation techniques for array of size M antennas. Although many solutions for\nmitigating strong RFI improves the quality of the final celestial source\nsignal, many standard approaches require all the eigenvalues of the spatial\ncovariance matrix ($\\textbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{M \\times M}$) of the received\nsignal, which has $O(M^3)$ computation complexity for removing RFI of size $d$\nwhere $\\textit{d} \\ll M$.

          "abstract": "The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the\nEpoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic\nGalactic foreground, which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm\nsignal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces\nadditional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In\nthis paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment,\nwhere the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be\nused. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the\nforeground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple\nregions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the\nfull covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the\n21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest\nwavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm\nsignals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing\nantenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is\nrobust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent\ndesign and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical\nsolution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in\nspace.",

Here, we extend the evaluation of the BFCC model to\nlower amplitude 21-cm signal scenarios where deriving reliable conclusions\nabout a model's capacity to recover unbiased 21-cm signal estimates using BFBMC\nis more challenging. Using realistic simulations of chromaticity-corrected\nEDGES-low spectrometer data, we evaluate three signal amplitude regimes --\nnull, moderate, and high.

The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are\nincoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent\nexcess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this\npaper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process\nregression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them\nfrom the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of\nobservation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic\nsignals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric\nvisibility cubes.

The algorithm naturally produces sparse images at each iteration,\nleveraged to reduce memory and computational requirements.

          "abstract": "Radio-interferometric (RI) imaging entails solving high-resolution\nhigh-dynamic range inverse problems from large data volumes. Recent image\nreconstruction techniques grounded in optimization theory have demonstrated\nremarkable capability for imaging precision, well beyond CLEAN's capability.\nThese range from advanced proximal algorithms propelled by handcrafted\nregularization operators, such as the SARA family, to hybrid plug-and-play\n(PnP) algorithms propelled by learned regularization denoisers, such as AIRI.\nOptimization and PnP structures are however highly iterative, which hinders\ntheir ability to handle the extreme data sizes expected from future\ninstruments. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a novel deep\nlearning approach, dubbed \"Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic\nrange imaging\". R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images,\niteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the\nprevious iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. It\nthus takes a hybrid structure between a PnP algorithm and a learned version of\nthe matching pursuit algorithm that underpins CLEAN. We present a comprehensive\nstudy of our approach, featuring its multiple incarnations distinguished by\ntheir DNN architectures. We provide a detailed description of its training\nprocess, targeting a telescope-specific approach. R2D2's capability to deliver\nhigh precision is demonstrated in simulation, across a variety of image and\nobservation settings using the Very Large Array (VLA). Its reconstruction speed\nis also demonstrated: with only few iterations required to clean data residuals\nat dynamic ranges up to 100000, R2D2 opens the door to fast precision imaging.\nR2D2 codes are available in the BASPLib library on GitHub.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a new class of iterative image reconstruction algorithms for\nradio interferometry, at the interface of convex optimization and deep\nlearning, inspired by plug-and-play methods. The approach consists in learning\na prior image model by training a deep neural network (DNN) as a denoiser, and\nsubstituting it for the handcrafted proximal regularization operator of an\noptimization algorithm. The proposed AIRI (``AI for Regularization in\nradio-interferometric Imaging'') framework, for imaging complex intensity\nstructure with diffuse and faint emission from visibility data, inherits the\nrobustness and interpretability of optimization, and the learning power and\nspeed of networks. Our approach relies on three steps. Firstly, we design a low\ndynamic range training database from optical intensity images. Secondly, we\ntrain a DNN denoiser at a noise level inferred from the signal-to-noise ratio\nof the data. We use training losses enhanced with a nonexpansiveness term\nensuring algorithm convergence, and including on-the-fly database dynamic range\nenhancement via exponentiation. Thirdly, we plug the learned denoiser into the\nforward-backward optimization algorithm, resulting in a simple iterative\nstructure alternating a denoising step with a gradient-descent data-fidelity\nstep. We have validated AIRI against CLEAN, optimization algorithms of the SARA\nfamily, and a DNN trained to reconstruct the image directly from visibility\ndata. Simulation results show that AIRI is competitive in imaging quality with\nSARA and its unconstrained forward-backward-based version uSARA, while\nproviding significant acceleration. CLEAN remains faster but offers lower\nquality. The end-to-end DNN offers further acceleration, but with far lower\nquality than AIRI.",

We report the results of over 16,000 independent measurements of\nnearly 2800 individual satellites. In addition to photometry, we also measured\nthe astrometric position of each satellite and evaluated the accuracy of\npredicting satellite position with the available two-line element sets. The\napparent brightness of a satellite seen in the sky is not constant and depends\non the Sun-satellite-observer geometry. To capture this, we designed the survey\nto create an all-geometries set of measurements to fully characterize the\nbrightness of each population of satellites as seen in the sky. We visualize\nthe data with sky-plots that show the correlation of apparent brightness with\non-sky position and relative Sun-satellite-observer geometry. The sky-plots\nshow where in the sky the satellites are brightest. In addition to visual\nmagnitudes, we also present two new metrics: the expected photon flux and the\neffective albedo. The expected photon flux metric assesses the potential impact\non astronomy sensors by predicting the flux for a satellite trail in an image\nfrom a theoretical 1 m class telescope and sensor. The effective albedo metric\nassesses where a satellite is more reflective than baseline, which ties to the\nphysical structure of the satellite and indicates the potential for\nbrightness-reducing design changes. We intend to use this methodology and\nresulting data to inform the astronomy community about satellite brightness.",

With the Pomenis LEO\nSatellite Photometric Survey our team has made over 14,000 observations of\nStarlink and OneWeb satellites to measure their apparent brightness. From the\napparent brightness of each satellite, we calculate a new metric: the effective\nalbedo, which quantifies the specularity of the reflecting satellite. Unlike\nstellar magnitude units, the effective albedo accounts for apparent range and\nphase angle and enables direct comparison of different satellites. Mapping the\neffective albedo from multiple observations across the sky produces an all-sky\nphotometric signature which is distinct for each population of satellites,\nincluding the various sub-models of Starlink satellites. Space Situational\nAwareness (SSA) practitioners can use all-sky photometric signatures to\ndifferentiate populations of satellites, compare their reflection\ncharacteristics, identify unknown satellites, and find anomalous members. To\ntest the efficacy of all-sky signatures for satellite identification, we\napplied a machine learning classifier algorithm which correctly identified the\nmajority of satellites based solely on the effective albedo metric and with as\nfew as one observation per individual satellite. Our new method of LEO\nsatellite photometric characterization requires no prior knowledge of the\nsatellite's properties and is readily scalable to large numbers of satellites\nsuch as those expected with developing communications mega-constellations.",

For the general case in which the reflectivities\nare initially unknown, we simulate LSST operations and repeated photometry of\nevery satellite in simulated model constellations. We derive a brightness model\nof the Starlink V2 satellite and study the simulated apparent brightness as a\nfunction of the satellite position relative to the observer and the sun. We\nfind that the V2 Starlink satellites appear brightest at two distinct positions\nin the sky: when oriented toward the sun at low elevations where light is\nspecularly reflected, and nearly overhead where the satellite is closest to the\nobserver.\n  A simulation of Starlink V2 satellites at 550 km height distributed across a\nseries of Walker constellations with varying inclinations was analyzed to study\nthe impact on the LSST observations.\n  Some bright satellites will be visible in LSST observations. For every\nthousand V1.5 Starlink satellites imaged by LSST in the first hour of a summer\nnight, we find 1.2 of them will appear brighter than 7 AB magnitude. By\ncomparison, for every thousand V2 Starlink satellites observed, we find only\n0.93 of them will appear this bright. The off-pointed solar array and reduced\ndiffuse reflection of the chassis mitigate the brightness.\n  Finally, we simulate lowering this Walker constellation to 350km. Only 0.56\nV2 Starlink satellites per thousand brighter than 7 AB magnitude will be\nobserved in the first hour at this height. This is a 40% reduction in number of\nbright satellites entering the focal plane compared to the constellation at\n550km height.
