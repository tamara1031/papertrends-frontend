This paper is the first to address the learning of Gr\\\"obner\nbasis computation with Transformers. The training requires many pairs of a\npolynomial system and the associated Gr\\\"obner basis, raising two novel\nalgebraic problems: random generation of Gr\\\"obner bases and transforming them\ninto non-Gr\\\"obner ones, termed as backward Gr\\\"obner problem.

          "abstract": "Solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems using Gr\\\"obner bases is usually\ndone by, first, computing a Gr\\\"obner basis for the degree reverse\nlexicographic order, and next computing the lexicographic Gr\\\"obner basis with\na change of order algorithm. Currently, the change of order now takes a\nsignificant part of the whole solving time for many generic instances.\n  Like the fastest known change of order algorithms, this work focuses on the\nsituation where the ideal defined by the system satisfies natural properties\nwhich can be recovered in generic coordinates. First, the ideal has a\n\\emph{shape} lexicographic Gr\\\"obner basis. Second, the set of leading terms\nwith respect to the degree reverse lexicographic order has a \\emph{stability}\nproperty; in particular, the multiplication matrix can be read on the input\nGr\\\"obner basis.\n  The current fastest algorithms rely on the sparsity of this matrix. Actually,\nthis sparsity is a consequence of an algebraic structure, which can be\nexploited to represent the matrix concisely as a univariate polynomial matrix.\nWe show that the Hermite normal form of that matrix yields the sought\nlexicographic Gr\\\"obner basis, under assumptions which cover the shape position\ncase. Under some mild assumption implying $n \\le t$, the arithmetic complexity\nof our algorithm is $O\\tilde{~}(t^{\\omega-1}D)$, where $n$ is the number of\nvariables, $t$ is a sparsity indicator of the aforementioned matrix, $D$ is the\ndegree of the zero-dimensional ideal under consideration, and $\\omega$ is the\nexponent of matrix multiplication. This improves upon both state-of-the-art\ncomplexity bounds $O\\tilde{~}(tD^2)$ and $O\\tilde{~}(D^\\omega)$, since $\\omega\n< 3$ and $t\\le D$.

For\nexample, those arising in the computation of the critical values of a\npolynomial restricted to a variety for polynomial optimisation. Gr\\\"obner bases\nare a classical tool for solving polynomial systems. For practical\ncomputations, this consists of two stages. First, a Gr\\\"obner basis is computed\nwith respect to a DRL (degree reverse lexicographic) ordering. Then, a change\nof ordering algorithm, such as \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM}, designed by Faug\\`ere and\nMou, is used to find a Gr\\\"obner basis of the same ideal but with respect to a\nlexicographic ordering. The complexity of this latter step, in terms of\narithmetic operations, is $O(mD^2)$, where $D$ is the degree of the ideal and\n$m$ is the number of non-trivial columns of a certain $D \\times D$ matrix.\nWhile asymptotic estimates are known for $m$ for generic polynomial systems,\nthus far, the complexity of \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM} was unknown for determinantal\nsystems.\n  By assuming Fr\\\"oberg's conjecture we expand the work of Moreno-Soc\\'ias by\ndetailing the structure of the DRL staircase in the determinantal setting.

Consequently, we arrive at a new bound on the\ncomplexity of the \\textsf{Sparse-FGLM} algorithm for generic determinantal\nsystems and for generic critical point systems.

Although Puiseux monoids are torsion-free rank-one monoids, their\natomic structure is rich and highly complex. For this reason, they have been\nimportant objects to construct crucial examples in commutative algebra and\nfactorization theory. In 1974 Anne Grams used a Puiseux monoid to construct the\nfirst example of an atomic domain not satisfying the ACCP, disproving Cohn's\nconjecture that every atomic domain satisfies the ACCP. Even recently, Jim\nCoykendall and Felix Gotti have used Puiseux monoids to construct the first\natomic monoids with monoid algebras (over a field) that are not atomic,\nanswering a question posed by Robert Gilmer back in the 1980s.\n  This dissertation is focused on the investigation of the atomic structure and\nfactorization theory of Puiseux monoids. Here we established various sufficient\nconditions for a Puiseux monoid to be atomic (or satisfy the ACCP). We do the\nsame for two of the most important atomic properties: the finite-factorization\nproperty and the bounded-factorization property. Then we compare these four\natomic properties in the context of Puiseux monoids.
