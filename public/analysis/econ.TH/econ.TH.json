Myerson pointed out an elegant linear\nprogramming solution that relies on the revelation principle. This paper\nextends Myerson's results to a more general setting where the principal's\naction space can be infinite and subject to additional design constraints.\n  Our generalized principal-agent model unifies several important design\nproblems including contract design, information design, and Bayesian\nStackelberg games, and encompasses them as special cases. We first extend the\nrevelation principle to this general model, based on which a polynomial-time\nalgorithm is then derived for computing the optimal mechanism for the\nprincipal. This algorithm not only implies new efficient solutions\nsimultaneously for all the aforementioned special cases but also significantly\nsimplifies previously known algorithms designed for special cases. Inspired by\nthe recent interest in the algorithmic design of a single contract and menu of\ncontracts, we study such constrained design problems to our general\nprincipal-agent model. In contrast to the above unification, our results here\nillustrate the other facet of diversity among different principal-agent design\nproblems and demonstrate how their different structures can lead to different\ncomplexities: some are tractable whereas others are APX-hard. Finally, we\nreveal an interesting connection of our model to the problem of information\nacquisition for decision making and study its algorithmic properties in\ngeneral.",

In this paper, we are motivated by the following\nquestion: Is there a strategy-proof and envy-free random assignment mechanism\nmore efficient than equal division?\n  Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we further explore the\nincompatibility between efficiency and envy-freeness in the class of\nstrategy-proof mechanisms. We define a new notion of efficiency that is weaker\nthan ex-post efficiency and prove that any strategy-proof and envy-free\nmechanism must sacrifice efficiency even in this very weak sense.

          "abstract": "We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal\nmechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and\nnon-truthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction\nformat $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item\nauctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be\npaid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the\nprior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of\nrealized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism\nusing a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many\ncommon non-truthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and\nextends the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16] beyond truthful auctions.\n  Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as\nsimultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay\nauctions. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue\nguarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments,\naddressing an open question in the literature [RST17]. If all-pay auctions are\nused, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that\nthe auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after\nobserving agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for\nmulti-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal\nrevenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful\n$O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning\nvia online learning techniques.",

Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,\ne.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which\nvoting rule should be used?

Sometimes, voters may\nintentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for\ntheir own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that\ntheir top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their\nsecond-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result.

We then consider a wider class of games that\nconverge under a best-response dynamic, in which each player chooses their\noptimal pure strategy successively. We show that the frequency of convergent\ngames goes to zero as the number of players or the number of strategies goes to\ninfinity. In the $2$-player case, we show that for large games with at least\n$10$ strategies, convergent games with multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria\nare more likely than games with a unique Nash equilibrium. Our novel approach\nuses an $n$-partite graph to describe games.",

          "abstract": "The incentive-compatibility properties of blockchain transaction fee\nmechanisms have been investigated with *passive* block producers that are\nmotivated purely by the net rewards earned at the consensus layer. This paper\nintroduces a model of *active* block producers that have their own private\nvaluations for blocks (representing, for example, additional value derived from\nthe application layer). The block producer surplus in our model can be\ninterpreted as one of the more common colloquial meanings of the term ``MEV.''\n  The main results of this paper show that transaction fee mechanism design is\nfundamentally more difficult with active block producers than with passive\nones: with active block producers, no non-trivial or approximately\nwelfare-maximizing transaction fee mechanism can be incentive-compatible for\nboth users and block producers. These results can be interpreted as a\nmathematical justification for the current interest in augmenting transaction\nfee mechanisms with additional components such as order flow auctions, block\nproducer competition, trusted hardware, or cryptographic techniques.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, prominent blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum\nhave experienced explosive growth in transaction volume, leading to frequent\nsurges in demand for limited block space and causing transaction fees to\nfluctuate by orders of magnitude. Existing systems sell space using first-price\nauctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to\nbid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too\nlow, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,\nthey pay larger fees than necessary.\n  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,\nmost notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a\nhistory-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base\nfee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}\n-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past\nblocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks. We show its potential\nto reduce price volatility by providing examples for which the prices of\nEIP-1559 are unstable while the prices of the proposed mechanism are stable.\nMore generally, whenever the demand for the blockchain stabilizes, we ask if\nour mechanism is able to converge to a stable state. Our main result provides\nsufficient conditions in a probabilistic setting for which the proposed\nmechanism is approximately welfare optimal and the prices are stable. Our main\ntechnical contribution towards establishing stability is an iterative algorithm\nthat, given oracle access to a Lipschitz continuous and strictly concave\nfunction $f$, converges to a fixed point of $f$.",

          "abstract": "Demand for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is far larger than\nsupply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to\ninclude \"on-chain\" from the pool of all pending transactions. This paper\ninvestigates the problem of designing a blockchain transaction fee mechanism\nthrough the lens of mechanism design. We introduce two new forms of\nincentive-compatibility that capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the\nblockchain setting, one (MMIC) that protects against deviations by\nprofit-maximizing miners and one (OCA-proofness) that protects against\noff-chain collusion between miners and users.\n  This study is immediately applicable to a recent (August 5, 2021) and major\nchange to Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism, based on a proposal called\n\"EIP-1559.\" Historically, Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism was a\nfirst-price (pay-as-bid) auction. EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly\ncoupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a\nhistory-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of\nthe transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive\nreport card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also\ndominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden\ndemand spike. We also introduce an alternative design, the \"tipless mechanism,\"\nwhich offers an incomparable slate of incentive-compatibility guarantees -- it\nis MMIC and DSIC, and OCA-proof unless in the midst of a demand spike.",
