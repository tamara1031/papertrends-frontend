However, deciphering reaction\nmechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable\nchallenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several\nstate-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular\nrepresentation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where\nchemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper\nintroduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a\nhierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,\nUni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes\n3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a\n3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two\npre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and\nreaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a\nprogressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With\nprompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional\nperformance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task\nprediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10\ndatasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing\nmethods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.\nThis work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular\ncomputational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic\nreaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism\nunderstanding.",

In this work, we want to check the role of rotational excitation\ncollisions of H$^+_3$ with atomic hydrogen on its excitation temperature.\nMethods.

Here, we show that, by\nexploiting the collective character of molecular polaritons in conjunction with\nthe effect of polaron decoupling, i.e., the suppression of environmental\ninfluence on the polariton, a superreaction can be realized, involving a\ncollective enhancement of charge or excitation-energy transfer reaction rate in\na system of donors all coupled to a common acceptor. This effect is analogous\nto the phenomenon of superradiation. Since the polariton is a superposition\nstate of excitations of all the molecules coupled to the cavity, it is\nvulnerable to the effect of decoherence caused by energy fluctuations in\nmolecular systems. Consequently, in the absence of a strong light-matter\ninteraction, the reaction rate decreases significantly as the number of\nmolecules increases, even if the system starts from the polariton state. By\nturning on the light-matter interaction, the dynamic behavior of the system\nchanges dramatically, and the reaction rate increases with the number of\nmolecules, as expected for a superreaction.

Under\nweak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can\nbe neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode\nis large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective\nstrong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or\n``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality\nfactor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within\na cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission\nand the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as\noptical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward\nexplanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in\nmolecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved\nwithout the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this\nsimple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent\nnonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear\ndistinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through\nclassical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics\napproach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that\nnecessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can\noccur in the weak coupling regime.

Using the existing\nmechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve\nsignificant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field.\nThe recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange\ninteraction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable\nsignal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between\nthe biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the\ncurrent JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron\npolarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is\nassociated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power\nmicrowave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization\nimbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here,\nwe propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced\nsinglet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet\nexcitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet\ncross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead\nto the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This\ncommunication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as\nthe polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to\nenhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.",

          "abstract": "Optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offers an attractive approach to\nenhancing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nEfficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to\noperate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it\nparticularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or\nspatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical\nDNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron\nand nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature.\nThis necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental\nconditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument\nthat facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields\n(10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment\nenables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the\nability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse\nsequences involving millions of RF pulses. We describe innovations in the\ndevice design and demonstrate its operation on a model system of 13C nuclear\nspins in diamond polarized through optically pumped nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenters.

          "abstract": "Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR\nmodality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin\ninteractions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman\ninteractions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength\nor below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement\nof spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive\nmeans for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting\nsample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong\nexternal magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear\nspin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up\nnew capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to\nthe preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging.\nFurthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio\nband, the nuclear spins can be manipulated with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and\nhighly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to\nhigh-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive\nmaterials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not lead to resonance\nline broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable\npractical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative\nsimplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR\nhas become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity\nand their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization\nmethods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders\nof magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future\navenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.",

Kinetic models\ncoupled to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide quick and efficient ways\nto test the effect of operating conditions, fuel composition and combustor\ndesign compared to physical experiments. However, detailed chemical kinetic\nmodels are too computationally expensive for use in CFD. We propose a novel\ndata orientated three-step methodology to produce compact models that replicate\na target set of detailed model properties to a high fidelity. In the first\nstep, a reduced kinetic model is obtained by removing all non-essential species\nfrom the detailed model containing 118 species using path flux analysis (PFA).\nIt is then numerically optimised to replicate the detailed model's prediction\nin two rounds; First, to selected species (OH,H,CO and CH4) profiles in\nperfectly stirred reactor (PSR) simulations and then re-optimised to the\ndetailed model's prediction of the laminar flame speed. This is implemented by\na purposely developed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical Kinetics (MLOCK)\nalgorithm. The MLOCK algorithm systematically perturbs all three Arrhenius\nparameters for selected reactions and assesses the suitability of the new\nparameters through an objective error function which quantifies the error in\nthe compact model's calculation of the optimisation target. This strategy is\ndemonstrated through the production of a 19 species and a 15 species compact\nmodel for methane/air combustion. Both compact models are validated across a\nrange of 0D and 1D calculations across both lean and rich conditions and shows\ngood agreement to the parent detailed mechanism. The 15 species model is shown\nto outperform the current state-of-art models in both accuracy and range of\nconditions the model is valid over.",

The aim of this numerical study aims to understand the\noperation of this combustion concept better and present a robust framework for\ndistributed combustion modeling in a parameter range where such operation was\nnot predicted before by any existing theory. Further, liquid fuel combustion\nwas evaluated that brings additional complexity. Four operating conditions were\npresented at which distributed combustion was observed.

The Zimont turbulent flame speed model was used with significantly\nreduced coefficients to achieve distributed combustion. The droplets of\nairblast atomization were tracked in a Lagrangian frame.
