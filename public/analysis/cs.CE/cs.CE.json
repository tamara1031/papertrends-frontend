However, physics-informed neural network models suffer from\nseveral issues and can fail to provide accurate solutions in many scenarios. We\ndiscuss a few of these challenges and the techniques, such as the use of\nFourier transform, that can be used to resolve these issues. This paper\nproposes and develops a physics-informed neural network model that combines the\nresiduals of the strong form and the potential energy, yielding many loss terms\ncontributing to the definition of the loss function to be minimized. Hence, we\npropose using the coefficient of variation weighting scheme to dynamically and\nadaptively assign the weight for each loss term in the loss function. The\ndeveloped PINN model is standalone and meshfree. In other words, it can\naccurately capture the mechanical response without requiring any labeled data.\nAlthough the framework can be used for many solid mechanics problems, we focus\non three-dimensional (3D) hyperelasticity, where we consider two hyperelastic\nmodels. Once the model is trained, the response can be obtained almost\ninstantly at any point in the physical domain, given its spatial coordinates.\nWe demonstrate the framework's performance by solving different problems with\nvarious boundary conditions.",

          "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a new tool for solving boundary\nvalue problems by defining loss functions of neural networks based on governing\nequations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recent investigations\nhave shown that when designing loss functions for many engineering problems,\nusing first-order derivatives and combining equations from both strong and weak\nforms can lead to much better accuracy, especially when there are heterogeneity\nand variable jumps in the domain. This new approach is called the mixed\nformulation for PINNs, which takes ideas from the mixed finite element method.\nIn this method, the PDE is reformulated as a system of equations where the\nprimary unknowns are the fluxes or gradients of the solution, and the secondary\nunknowns are the solution itself. In this work, we propose applying the mixed\nformulation to solve multi-physical problems, specifically a stationary\nthermo-mechanically coupled system of equations. Additionally, we discuss both\nsequential and fully coupled unsupervised training and compare their accuracy\nand computational cost. To improve the accuracy of the network, we incorporate\nhard boundary constraints to ensure valid predictions. We then investigate how\ndifferent optimizers and architectures affect accuracy and efficiency. Finally,\nwe introduce a simple approach for parametric learning that is similar to\ntransfer learning. This approach combines data and physics to address the\nlimitations of PINNs regarding computational cost and improves the network's\nability to predict the response of the system for unseen cases. The outcomes of\nthis work will be useful for many other engineering applications where deep\nlearning is employed on multiple coupled systems of equations for fast and\nreliable computations.",

We employ several ideas from the finite\nelement method (FEM) to enhance the performance of existing PINNs in\nengineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote\nusing the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated\nneural networks. Later on, the strong form which has a higher order of\nderivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the\nphysical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem is\napplied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The\nproposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the\nphysical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through\nvarious comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs\nand FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and\nits energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear\ninterpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element\nnodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids to\nshow the capability of deep learning for predicting the solution in a complex\nenvironment under different boundary conditions. The performance of the\nproposed PINN model is checked against the solution from FEM on two prototype\nproblems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem).\nWe concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the\ndeep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous\ndomain without any available initial data from other sources.

          "abstract": "Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are commonly used within\nComputer-Aided Design (CAD) tools to represent geometric objects. When using\nisogeometric analysis (IGA), it is possible to use such NURBS geometries for\nnumerical analysis directly. Analyzing fluid flows, however, requires complex\nthree-dimensional geometries to represent flow domains. Defining a\nparametrization of such volumetric domains using NURBS can be challenging and\nis still an ongoing topic in the IGA community. With the recently developed\nNURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM), the favorable geometric\ncharacteristics of NURBS are used within a standard finite element method. This\nis achieved by enhancing the elements touching the boundary by using the NURBS\ngeometry itself. In the current work, a new variation of NEFEM is introduced,\nwhich is suitable for three-dimensional space-time finite element formulations.\nThe proposed method makes use of a new mapping which results in a non-Cartesian\nformulation suitable for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This is\ndemonstrated by combining the method with an IGA formulation in a\nstrongly-coupled partitioned framework for solving FSI problems. The framework\nyields a fully spline-based representation of the fluid-structure interface\nthrough a single NURBS. The coupling conditions at the fluid-structure\ninterface are enforced through a Robin-Neumann type coupling scheme. This\nscheme is particularly useful when considering incompressible fluids in fully\nDirichlet-bounded and curved problems, as it satisfies the incompressibility\nconstraint on the fluid for each step within the coupling procedure. The\naccuracy and performance of the introduced spline-based space-time finite\nelement approach and its use within the proposed coupled FSI framework are\ndemonstrated using a series of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems.",

The concomitant growth in charging demand has posed challenges for\nboth networks, highlighting the importance of charging coordination. Existing\nliterature largely overlooks the interactions between power grid security and\ntraffic efficiency. In view of this, we study the en-route charging station\n(CS) recommendation problem for EVs in dynamically coupled transportation-power\nsystems. The system-level objective is to maximize the overall traffic\nefficiency while ensuring the safety of the power grid. This problem is for the\nfirst time formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an\nonline prediction-assisted safe reinforcement learning (OP-SRL) method is\nproposed to learn the optimal and secure policy by extending the PPO method. To\nbe specific, we mainly address two challenges. First, the constrained\noptimization problem is converted into an equivalent unconstrained optimization\nproblem by applying the Lagrangian method. Second, to account for the uncertain\nlong-time delay between performing CS recommendation and commencing charging,\nwe put forward an online sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) predictor for state\naugmentation to guide the agent in making forward-thinking decisions.

          "abstract": "As large language models become increasingly prevalent in the financial\nsector, there is a pressing need for a standardized method to comprehensively\nassess their performance. However, existing finance benchmarks often suffer\nfrom limited language and task coverage, as well as challenges such as\nlow-quality datasets and inadequate adaptability for LLM evaluation. To address\nthese limitations, we propose \"Golden Touchstone\", the first comprehensive\nbilingual benchmark for financial LLMs, which incorporates representative\ndatasets from both Chinese and English across eight core financial NLP tasks.\nDeveloped from extensive open source data collection and industry-specific\ndemands, this benchmark includes a variety of financial tasks aimed at\nthoroughly assessing models' language understanding and generation\ncapabilities. Through comparative analysis of major models on the benchmark,\nsuch as GPT-4o Llama3, FinGPT and FinMA, we reveal their strengths and\nlimitations in processing complex financial information. Additionally, we\nopen-sourced Touchstone-GPT, a financial LLM trained through continual\npre-training and financial instruction tuning, which demonstrates strong\nperformance on the bilingual benchmark but still has limitations in specific\ntasks.This research not only provides the financial large language models with\na practical evaluation tool but also guides the development and optimization of\nfuture research. The source code for Golden Touchstone and model weight of\nTouchstone-GPT have been made publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/Golden-Touchstone}, contributing to the\nongoing evolution of FinLLMs and fostering further research in this critical\narea.",

          "abstract": "In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only\ntiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such\nas GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has\nrevealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT\non discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,\nsuch as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on\ngenerative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods\nto provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing\nsuboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are\nadditional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic\nmodeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained\non a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the\nlargest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter\nsize. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the\nfinancial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)\nDiscriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT\nvariants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five\nfinancial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models\n(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\\% avg improvement over\nBGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\\% avg improvement over OpenAI's\ntext-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)\nBuilding on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables\nsuperior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work\nrevisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary\nLLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the\nLLMs era.",

In the proposed formulation,\nthe computational domain is decomposed into two overlapping domains: the SIE\nand PDE domains. In the SIE domain, complex structures with piecewise\nhomogeneous media, e.g., highly conductive media, are included. An equivalent\nmodel for those structures is constructed by replacing them with the background\nmedium and introducing a surface equivalent electric current density on an\nenclosed boundary to represent their electromagnetic effects. The remaining\ncomputational domain and homogeneous background medium replaced domain consist\nof the PDE domain, in which inhomogeneous or non-isotropic media are included.\nThrough combining the surface equivalent electric current density and the\ninhomogeneous Helmholtz equation, a hybrid SIE-PDE formulation is derived. It\nrequires no boundary conditions, and is mathematically equivalent to the\noriginal physical model. Through careful construction of basis functions to\nexpand electric fields and the equivalent current density, the discretized\nformulation is made compatible with the SIE and PDE domain interface. The\naccuracy and efficiency are validated through two numerical examples.

However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding\nquantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the\ninput quantum state is a low-rank tensor and all intermediate states of the\nquantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low-rank tensors. In\nthis paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms\nby using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input\nand all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms\nare used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms\npreserve the low-rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently\nsimulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states\nin other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation\nmore difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or\nsuperiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer. As a result,\nunderstanding the low-rank structure of a quantum algorithm allows us to\nidentify algorithms that can benefit significantly from quantum computers.",
