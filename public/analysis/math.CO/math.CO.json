Aboulker et al. made a\nconjecture which answers this question in graphs of bounded maximum degree,\nasserting that for all $k$ and $\\Delta$, every graph with maximum degree at\nmost $\\Delta$ and sufficiently large treewidth contains either a subdivision of\nthe $(k\\times k)$-wall or the line graph of a subdivision of the $(k\\times\nk)$-wall as an induced subgraph. We prove two theorems supporting this\nconjecture, as follows.\n  1. For $t\\geq 2$, a $t$-theta is a graph consisting of two nonadjacent\nvertices and three internally disjoint paths between them, each of length at\nleast $t$. A $t$-pyramid is a graph consisting of a vertex $v$, a triangle $B$\ndisjoint from $v$ and three paths starting at $v$ and disjoint otherwise, each\njoining $v$ to a vertex of $B$, and each of length at least $t$. We prove that\nfor all $k,t$ and $\\Delta$, every graph with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$\nand sufficiently large treewidth contains either a $t$-theta, or a $t$-pyramid,\nor the line graph of a subdivision of the $(k\\times k)$-wall as an induced\nsubgraph. This affirmatively answers a question of Pilipczuk et al. asking\nwhether every graph of bounded maximum degree and sufficiently large treewidth\ncontains either a theta or a triangle as an induced subgraph (where a theta\nmeans a $t$-theta for some $t\\geq 2$).\n  2. A subcubic subdivided caterpillar is a tree of maximum degree at most\nthree whose all vertices of degree three lie on a path. We prove that for every\n$\\Delta$ and subcubic subdivided caterpillar $T$, every graph with maximum\ndegree at most $\\Delta$ and sufficiently large treewidth contains either a\nsubdivision of $T$ or the line graph of a subdivision of $T$ as an induced\nsubgraph.",

In any finite word one may delete the repeated block of a square,\nobtaining thereby a shorter word. By repeating this process, a square-free word\nis eventually reached, which we call a \\emph{reduct} of the original word.\n  How many different reducts a single word may have? It is not hard to prove\nthat any binary word has exactly one reduct. We prove that there exist ternary\nwords with arbitrarily many reducts. Moreover, the function counting the\nmaximum number of reducts a ternary word of length $n$ may have grows\nexponentially. We also prove that over four letters, there exist words with any\ngiven number of reducts, which does not seem to be the case for ternary words.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the set of all finite ternary words splits into\nfinitely many classes of \\emph{related} words (one may get from one word to the\nother by a sequence of square reductions and factor duplications). A few open\nquestions are posed concerning some structures on words defined with the use of\nthe square reduction.",

Infinite matroids were only recently\naxiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the\nconjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that\nare now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are\nfinite sets.\n  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related\nconjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and\nonly if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all\nmatroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture\nasks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in\na way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first\nsubset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second\nsubset admits a covering.\n  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our\nmain tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated\nnonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a\nhyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the\noriginal ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite\nstructure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be\ndirectly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.",

However, the\nreconstruction of phylogenetic networks remains challenging and computationally\nexpensive due to their intricate structural properties. For example, the small\nparsimony problem that is solvable in polynomial time for phylogenetic trees,\nbecomes NP-hard on phylogenetic networks under softwired and parental\nparsimony, even for a single binary character and structurally constrained\nnetworks. To calculate the parsimony score of a phylogenetic network $N$, these\ntwo parsimony notions consider different exponential-size sets of phylogenetic\ntrees that can be extracted from $N$ and infer the minimum parsimony score over\nall trees in the set. In this paper, we ask: What is the maximum difference\nbetween the parsimony score of any phylogenetic tree that is contained in the\nset of considered trees and a phylogenetic tree whose parsimony score equates\nto the parsimony score of $N$? Given a gap-free sequence alignment of\nmulti-state characters and a rooted binary level-$k$ phylogenetic network, we\nuse the novel concept of an informative blob to show that this difference is\nbounded by $k+1$ times the softwired parsimony score of $N$. In particular, the\ndifference is independent of the alignment length and the number of character\nstates.
