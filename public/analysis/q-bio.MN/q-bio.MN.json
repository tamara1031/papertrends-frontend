          "abstract": "We are concerned with polynomial ordinary differential systems that arise\nfrom modelling chemical reaction networks. For such systems, which may be of\nhigh dimension and may depend on many parameters, it is frequently of interest\nto obtain a reduction of dimension in certain parameter ranges. Singular\nperturbation theory, as initiated by Tikhonov and Fenichel, provides a path\ntoward such reductions. In the present paper we discuss parameter values that\nlead to singular perturbation reductions (so-called Tikhonov-Fenichel parameter\nvalues, or TFPVs). An algorithmic approach is known, but it is feasible for\nsmall dimensions only. Here we characterize conditions for classes of reaction\nnetworks for which TFPVs arise by turning off reactions (by setting rate\nparameters to zero), or by removing certain species (which relates to the\nclassical quasi-steady state approach to model reduction). In particular, we\nobtain definitive results for the class of complex balanced reaction networks\n(of deficiency zero) and first order reaction networks.",

          "abstract": "We develop a model-independent reduction method of chemical reaction systems\nbased on the stoichiometry, which determines their network topology. A\nsubnetwork can be eliminated systematically to give a reduced system with fewer\ndegrees of freedom. This subnetwork removal is accompanied by rewiring of the\nnetwork, which is prescribed by the Schur complement of the stoichiometric\nmatrix. Using homology and cohomology groups to characterize the topology of\nchemical reaction networks, we can track the changes of the network topology\ninduced by the reduction through the changes in those groups. We prove that,\nwhen certain topological conditions are met, the steady-state chemical\nconcentrations and reaction rates of the reduced system are ensured to be the\nsame as those of the original system. This result holds regardless of the\nmodeling of the reactions, namely chemical kinetics, since the conditions only\ninvolve topological information. This is advantageous because the details of\nreaction kinetics and parameter values are difficult to identify in many\npractical situations. The method allows us to reduce a reaction network while\npreserving its original steady-state properties, thereby complex reaction\nsystems can be studied efficiently. We demonstrate the reduction method in\nhypothetical networks and the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli.",

          "year": "2025-04",
          "abstract": "The evolution of chemical reaction networks is often analyzed through kinetic\nmodels and energy landscapes, but these approaches fail to capture the deeper\nstructural constraints governing complexity growth. In chemical reaction\nnetworks, emergent constraints dictate the organization of reaction pathways,\nlimiting combinatorial expansion and determining stability conditions. This\npaper introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks by\nincorporating differential geometry into the classical framework of reaction\nkinetics. By utilizing the Riemannian metric, Christoffel symbols, and a\nsystem-specific entropy-like term, we provide a new method for understanding\nthe evolution of complex reaction systems. The approach captures the\ninterdependence between species, the curvature of the reaction network's\nconfiguration space, and the tendency of the system to evolve toward more\nprobable states. The interaction topology constrains the accessible reaction\ntrajectories and the introduced differential geometrical approach allows\nanalysis of curvature constraints which help us to understand pathway\nsaturation and transition dynamics. Rather than treating reaction space as an\nunconstrained combinatorial landscape, we frame it as a structured manifold\nwith higher order curvature describing a geodesic for system evolution under\nintrinsic constraints. This geometrical perspective offers a unique insight\ninto pathway saturation, self-interruption, and emergent behavior in reaction\nnetworks, and provides a scalable framework for modeling large biochemical or\ncatalytic systems.",

Therefore, reliable molecule interaction data are\na crucial basis, where drug-/protein-protein interaction networks establish\ninvaluable, year-long carefully curated data resources. However, these\nresources have not yet been systematically exploited using high-performance\nartificial intelligence approaches. Here, we combine three networks, two of\nwhich are year-long curated, and one of which, on SARS-CoV-2-human host-virus\nprotein interactions, was published only most recently (30th of April 2020),\nraising a novel network that puts drugs, human and virus proteins into mutual\ncontext.

Reliable simulations confirm that we operate at\nutmost accuracy in terms of predicting missing links.

Many of these strategies rely on the\nrepositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost\ncompared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new\nnetwork-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching\noff-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by\nquantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific\nproteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure\nthat prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same\nnetwork neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14\nselected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing\ngenes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic\nsimilarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively\nrepurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we\nidentified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label\ndrugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,\nactually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of\nputative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential\nanti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity\nvalues. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,\nand thrombin inhibitors.

Drug repurposing is a promising\nstrategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due\nto several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results\ncompared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore\ncomputational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated\ngraph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.\nAlthough we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is\ngeneric and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered\nheterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases,\ngenes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem.\nSpecifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural\nnetwork (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered\ngraph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for\na disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as\nDexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different\npharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic).

This variation appears in organisms ranging from microbes to metazoans.\nStochastic gene expression has important consequences for cellular function.\nThe random fluctuations in protein levels produce variability in cellular\nbehavior. It is beneficial in some contexts and harmful to others. These\nsituations include stress response, metabolism, development, cell cycle,\ncircadian rhythms, and aging. Different model studies e.g., constitutive,\ntwo-state, etc., reveal that the fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels arise\nfrom different steps of gene expression among which the steps in transcription\nhave the maximum effect. The pulsatile mRNA production through RNAP-II based\nreinitiation of transcription is an important part of gene transcription.\nThough, the effect of that process on mRNA and protein levels is very little\nknown. The addition of any biochemical step in the constitutive or two-state\nprocess generally decreases the mean and increases the Fano factor. In this\nstudy, we have shown that the RNAP-II based reinitiation process in gene\ntranscription can have different effects on both mean and Fano factor at mRNA\nlevels in different model systems. It decreases the mean and Fano factor both\nat the mRNA levels in the constitutive network whereas in other networks it can\nsimultaneously increase or decrease both quantities or it can have mixed-effect\nat mRNA levels.

          "abstract": "Gene expression is a fundamental process in a living system. The small RNAs\n(sRNAs) is widely observed as a global regulator in gene expression. The\ninherent nonlinearity in this regulatory process together with the bursty\nproduction of messenger RNA (mRNA), sRNA and protein make the exact solution\nfor this stochastic process intractable. This is particularly the case when\nquantifying the protein noise level, which has great impact on multiple\ncellular processes. Here we propose an approximate yet reasonably accurate\nsolution for the gene expression noise with infrequent burst and strong\nregulation by sRNAs. This analytical solution allows us to better analyze the\nnoise and stochastic deviation of protein level. We find that the regulation\namplifies the noise, reduces the protein level. The stochasticity in the\nregulation generates more proteins than what if the stochasticity is removed\nfrom the system. The sRNA level is most important to the relationship between\nthe noise and stochastic deviation. The results provide analytical tools for\nmore general studies of gene expression and strengthen our quantitative\nunderstandings of post-transcriptional regulation in controlling gene\nexpression processes.",

          "abstract": "Asynchronous Boolean networks are a type of discrete dynamical system in\nwhich each variable can take one of two states, and a single variable state is\nupdated in each time step according to pre-selected rules. Boolean networks are\npopular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological\nphenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model\nphenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces\n(inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological\napplications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one\ncorrespondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant\nattractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.\n  MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we\nsummarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several\nnovel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and\nlinear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an\nensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological\nsystems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings\nquantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological\nmodels), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into\nthe dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in\nsparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs.\nMotivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of\ndelays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.",

The stability\nof a Boolean network depends on various factors, such as the topology of its\nwiring diagram and the type of the functions describing its dynamics. In this\npaper, we study the stability of linear Boolean networks by computing Derrida\ncurves and quantifying the number of attractors and cycle lengths imposed by\ntheir network topologies. Derrida curves are commonly used to measure the\nstability of Boolean networks and several parameters such as the average\nin-degree K and the output bias p can indicate if a network is stable,\ncritical, or unstable. For random unbiased Boolean networks there is a critical\nconnectivity value Kc=2 such that if K<Kc networks operate in the ordered\nregime, and if K>Kc networks operate in the chaotic regime. Here, we show that\nfor linear networks, which are the least canalizing and most unstable, the\nphase transition from order to chaos already happens at an average in-degree of\nKc=1. Consistently, we also show that unstable networks exhibit a large number\nof attractors with very long limit cycles while stable and critical networks\nexhibit fewer attractors with shorter limit cycles. Additionally, we present\ntheoretical results to quantify important dynamical properties of linear\nnetworks. First, we present a formula for the proportion of attractor states in\nlinear systems. Second, we show that the expected number of fixed points in\nlinear systems is 2, while general Boolean networks possess on average one\nfixed point.

Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming\nthem into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded\nwith a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene\nacross all networks.

A common practice for single\ncell GRN analysis is to first cluster the cells and infer GRNs for every\ncluster separately.
