The neutral scalars in the\nsecond Higgs doublet couple to $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ and largely contribute to the\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment through the one-loop diagram involving $\\tau$\nand scalars. An additional singlet scalar which is charged under the discrete\nsymmetry can be a dark matter candidate. An upper limit on the scalar mass\noriginates from the unitarity constraint, and the $\\mu\\tau$ flavor-violating\nnature of the scalars predicts non-standard signatures at the LHC. However, the\npreviously proposed $\\mu^\\pm\\mu^\\pm\\tau^\\mp\\tau^\\mp$ signal via the electroweak\nheavy neutral scalar pair production at the LHC loses sensitivity for\nincreasing scalar mass. We revisit this model and investigate the LHC prospects\nfor the single production of the $\\mu\\tau$ flavor-violating neutral scalar. It\nis shown that the single scalar process helps to extend the LHC reach to the\n1$\\,$TeV mass regime of the scenario. The search potential at the high energy\nLHC is also discussed.",

Such a dark Higgs\nmechanism may in particular give mass to a dark matter candidate and to the\ngauge boson mediating its interactions (called dark photon). In this review we\nsummarise the phenomenology of the resulting dark Higgs boson and discuss the\ncorresponding search strategies with a focus on collider experiments. We\nconsider both the case that the dark Higgs boson is heavier than the SM Higgs\nboson, in which case leading constraints come from direct searches for new\nHiggs bosons as well missing-energy searches at the LHC, and the case that the\ndark Higgs boson is (potentially much) lighter than the SM Higgs boson, such\nthat the leading sensitivity comes from electron-positron colliders and\nfixed-target experiments. Of particular experimental interest for both cases is\nthe associated production of a dark Higgs boson with a dark photon, which\nsubsequently decays into SM fermions, dark matter particles or long-lived dark\nsector states. We also discuss the important role of exotic decays of the\nSM-like Higgs boson and complementary constraints arising from early-universe\ncosmology, astrophysics and direct searches for dark matter in laboratory\nexperiments.",

In\nthis scenario, coupling constants of the discovered Higgs boson to the Standard\nModel (SM) particles are identical to those of the SM Higgs boson, and flavor\nchanging neutral currents via neutral Higgs bosons do not appear at tree level.\nWe investigate current constraints and future prospects of the model by using\nmeasurements from flavor experiments and data of multi-lepton final states at\nLHC. Especially, we focus on the electroweak pair production of the additional\nHiggs bosons with their masses below $2m_t$. We find that the most of the\nparameter space are already excluded by the current LHC data when the leptonic\ndecays of the additional Higgs bosons are dominant, which can be interpreted to\nthe scenario in the Type-X THDM as a special case.

Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance,\napproaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational\ncomplexity.

This data presents\nsignificant challenges due to its volume and complex reconstruction,\nnecessitating the use of advanced analysis techniques for analysis. Recent\nadvancements in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks, have shown\npromising results in addressing the challenges but remain computationally\nexpensive. The study presented in this paper uses a simulated particle\ncollision dataset to integrate influence analysis inside the graph\nclassification pipeline aiming at improving the accuracy and efficiency of\ncollision event prediction tasks. By using a Graph Neural Network for initial\ntraining, we applied a gradient-based data influence method to identify\ninfluential training samples and then we refined the dataset by removing\nnon-contributory elements: the model trained on this new reduced dataset can\nachieve good performances at a reduced computational cost. The method is\ncompletely agnostic to the specific influence method: different influence\nmodalities can be easily integrated into our methodology.

In contrast to the\nmeasurements in Pb-Pb collisions, the $v_2$ coefficient is also found\nindependent of $p_{\\rm T}$ within uncertainties. Comparisons with the inclusive\ncharged-particle $v_2$ and with AMPT calculations are discussed. The\npredictions suggest that parton interactions play an important role in\ngenerating a non-zero jet-particle $v_2$ in p-Pb collisions, even though they\noverestimate the reported measurement.

We perform a detailed comparison\nof precision calculations for Higgs boson production in this channel, with\nparticular emphasis on large Higgs boson transverse momenta, and on the jet\nradius dependence of the cross section. We study fixed-order predictions at NLO\nand NNLO QCD, and compare the results to NLO plus parton shower (NLOPS) matched\ncalculations. The impact of the NNLO corrections on the central predictions is\nmild, with inclusive scale uncertainties of the order of a few percent, which\ncan increase with the imposition of kinematic cuts. We find good agreement\nbetween the fixed-order and matched calculations in non-Sudakov regions, and\nthe various NLOPS predictions also agree well in the Sudakov regime.

A second part is devoted to other neutrino properties\npredicted in neutrino mass models. The topics covered include the study of\nspin-flavour precession in solar neutrinos from non-zero neutrino magnetic\nmoments, the prospects for neutrino non-standard interactions with quarks from\nthe solar sector and the expected limits on CPT violation from a separate\nanalysis of neutrino and antineutrino data. Regarding cosmology, the impact of\nnon-standard interactions with electrons and a non-unitary three-neutrino\nmixing matrix in the process of neutrino decoupling are addressed. Finally, a\nthird part explores possible connections between dark matter and neutrinos. The\nexistence of dark matter has been proven indirectly via its gravitational\neffects.

          "abstract": "A thorough understanding of neutrino-nucleus scattering physics is crucial\nfor the successful execution of the entire US neutrino physics program.\nNeutrino-nucleus interaction constitutes one of the biggest systematic\nuncertainties in neutrino experiments - both at intermediate energies affecting\nlong-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), as well as at low\nenergies affecting coherent scattering neutrino program - and could well be the\ndifference between achieving or missing discovery level precision. To this end,\nelectron-nucleus scattering experiments provide vital information to test,\nassess and validate different nuclear models and event generators intended to\nbe used in neutrino experiments. In this white paper, we highlight connections\nbetween electron- and neutrino-nucleus scattering physics at energies ranging\nfrom 10s of MeV to a few GeV, review the status of ongoing and planned electron\nscattering experiments, identify gaps, and layout a path forward that benefits\nthe neutrino community. We also highlight the systemic challenges with respect\nto the divide between the nuclear and high-energy physics communities and\nfunding that presents additional hurdle in mobilizing these connections to the\nbenefit of neutrino programs.",

          "abstract": "The prospects of extracting new physics signals in coherent elastic\nneutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) processes are limited by the precision\nwith which the underlying nuclear structure physics, embedded in the weak\nnuclear form factor, is known. We present calculations of charge and weak\nnuclear form factors and CE$\\nu$NS cross sections on $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O,\n$^{40}$Ar, $^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb nuclei. We obtain the proton and neutron\ndensities, and charge and weak form factors by solving Hartree--Fock (HF)\nequations with a Skyrme (SkE2) nuclear potential. We validate our approach by\ncomparing $^{208}$Pb and $^{40}$Ar charge form factor predictions with\navailable elastic electron scattering data. Since CE$\\nu$NS experiments at\nstopped--pion sources are also well suited to measure inelastic\ncharged--current and neutral--current neutrino--nucleus cross sections, we also\npresent calculations for these processes, incorporating a continuum Random\nPhase Approximation (CRPA) description on top of the HF-SkE2 picture of the\nnucleus. Providing both coherent as well as inelastic cross sections in a\nconsistent framework, we aim at obtaining a reliable and detailed comparison of\nthe strength of these processes in the energy region below ~100 MeV.\nFurthermore, we attempt to gauge the level of theoretical uncertainty\npertaining to the description of the $^{40}$Ar form factor and CE$\\nu$NS cross\nsections by comparing relative differences between recent microscopic nuclear\ntheory and widely--used phenomenological form factor predictions. Future\nprecision measurements of CE$\\nu$NS will potentially help in constraining these\nnuclear structure details that will in turn improve prospects of extracting new\nphysics.",

          "abstract": "The upgrade of the LHC to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to\nincrease the current instantaneous luminosity by a factor of 5 to 7, providing\nthe opportunity to study rare processes and measure precisely the standard\nmodel parameters. To cope with the increase in pile-up (up to 200), particle\ndensity and radiation, CMS will build new silicon tracking devices with higher\ngranularity (to reduce occupancy) and improved radiation hardness. During the\nR&D period tests performed under beam are a powerful way to develop and examine\nthe behavior of silicon sensors in realistic conditions. The telescopes used up\nto now have a slow readout (less than 10 kHz) for the needs of the CMS\nexperiment, since the new outer-tracker modules have an effective\nreturn-to-zero time of 25 ns (corresponding to a 40 MHz frequency) and a\ntrigger rate of 750 kHz. In order to test the CMS Tracker modules under the LHC\nnominal rate, a pixel telescope named CHROMIE (CMS High Rate telescOpe MachInE)\nis designed, built and commissioned at CERN for beam tests with prototype\nmodules for the CMS Phase-2 Tracker upgrade. In this article the design of\nCHROMIE, the calibration of its modules, and its timing and synchronization\naspects are presented, along with the first beam test results. In addition, the\ntracking algorithm developed for CHROMIE and a preliminary Geant4 simulation\nstudy of the telescope under beam are discussed.",
