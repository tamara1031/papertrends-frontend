Fluctuations of the spin orientation are described by a\nnon-linear sigma model obtained from a gradient expansion of the spinon action.\nThe spin stiffnesses are computed from a renormalization group improved random\nphase approximation. Our approximations are applicable for a weak or moderate\nHubbard interaction. The spinon fluctuations prevent magnetic long-range order\nof the electrons at any finite temperature.

Our model\nconsists of a $D$-dimensional electron gas subject to an instantaneous\nelectron-electron interaction of a finite range exceeding the average\ninter-particle distance. Pair, charge and spin susceptibilities are evaluated\nvia the one-loop renormalization group theory and via the bosonization\napproach, giving identical results. In case of a repulsive interaction, we\nidentify an intrinsic Fermi liquid instability towards insulating spin/charge\ndensity wave order when the interaction coupling strength reaches a universal\ncritical value. If both electron and hole pockets of the same size are present,\nthe ground state is an excitonic insulator at arbitrarily small repulsive\ninteraction. If the interaction is attractive, the ground state is a singlet\nnon-BCS superconductor with a uniform condensate. In case if both electron and\nhole Fermi surfaces are present, we predict an instability towards the\ninter-pocket pair-density-wave ordering at the critical coupling. This\nprediction lends strong theoretical support to the pair-density-wave scenario\nof superconductivity in cuprate materials.

          "abstract": "Understanding the electron pairing in hole-doped cuprate superconductors has\nbeen a challenge, in particular because the \"normal\" state from which it\nevolves is unprecedented. Now, after three and a half decades of research,\ninvolving a wide range of experimental characterizations, it is possible to\ndelineate a clear and consistent cuprate story. It starts with doping holes\ninto a charge-transfer insulator, resulting in in-gap states. These states\nexhibit a pseudogap resulting from the competition between antiferromagnetic\nsuperexchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor Cu atoms (a real-space interaction)\nand the kinetic energy of the doped holes, which, in the absence of\ninteractions, would lead to extended Bloch-wave states whose occupancy is\ncharacterized in reciprocal space. To develop some degree of coherence on\ncooling, the spin and charge correlations must self-organize in a cooperative\nfashion. A specific example of resulting emergent order is that of spin and\ncharge stripes, as observed in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$. While stripe order\nfrustrates bulk superconductivity, it nevertheless develops pairing and\nsuperconducting order of an unusual character. The antiphase order of the spin\nstripes decouples them from the charge stripes, which can be viewed as\nhole-doped, two-leg, spin-$\\frac12$ ladders. To achieve superconducting order,\nthe pair correlations in neighboring ladders must develop phase order. In the\npresence of spin stripe order, antiphase Josephson coupling can lead to\npair-density-wave superconductivity. Alternatively, in-phase superconductivity\nrequires that the spin stripes have an energy gap, which empirically limits the\ncoherent superconducting gap. Hence, superconducting order in the cuprates\ninvolves a compromise between the pairing scale, which is maximized at\n$x\\sim\\frac18$, and phase coherence, which is optimized at $x\\sim0.2$.",

In this paper, we conduct a\ntheoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to\ntackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the\nmolecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni\ndimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly\ncorrelated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on\nindividual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron\ndelocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We\nfurther find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately\nlinked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two\ndistinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital\nphysics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a\nwell-established condition for unconventional high-temperature\nsuperconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni\n$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave\nstates and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several\nrecent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between\nthese two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in\nthis study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for\nsuperconductivity to occur.",

Although superconductivity mediated\nby nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically [3-7], it has yet to\nbe unambiguously identified experimentally [8, 9]. A major challenge is that\nnematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as\nmagnetism and charge order. The FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ family of iron based\nsuperconductors provides a unique opportunity to explore this concept, as it\nfeatures an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur\nsubstitution at a quantum critical point (QCP) near $x_c = 0.17$, where nematic\nfluctuations are the largest [10-12].

The results are also in contrast with pristine FeSe, where the\npairing is mediated by spin fluctuations and the gap minima are aligned with\nthe Fe-Fe direction. Therefore, the measured gap structure demonstrates not\nonly a fundamental change of the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of\nFeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, but it also indicates the existence of superconductivity\nmediated by nematic fluctuations in FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$.",

We perform an optical\npump-THz-THG drive experiment and use a two-dimensional spectroscopy approach\nto disentangle the driven third-harmonic response of optically excited\nquasiparticles and the pure condensate response.

Since then, various theoretical and experimental studies have\nbeen devoted to elucidating its microscopic origin. One prominent fingerprint\nof the light-induced superconductivity is the emergence of $1/\\omega$-like\nspectral behavior in the imaginary part of the optical conductivity in the\nterahertz (THz) frequency range. However, the spectral profile can also be\ndescribed by the Drude response of the quasiparticles (QPs) with a\nsubstantially low scattering rate. To circumvent this critical ambiguity, we\ninvestigated the light-induced nonequilibrium state in an underdoped YBCO\nsample with $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of 61 K using the nonlinear THz optical response\noriginating from the SC collective excitation of the ac-driven Josephson\ncurrent. Upon the near-infrared (NIR) photoexcitation above $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in\nthe YBCO sample, the $1/\\omega$-like spectral behavior in the imaginary part of\nthe optical conductivity emerges, consistent with the previous studies.\nHowever, the THz third-harmonic generation arising from the ac-driven Josephson\ncurrent along the $c$-axis was absent in the NIR photoexcited state. These\nresults indicate that the NIR-pump induced state exhibiting the $1/\\omega$-like\nresponse above $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is distinct from the long-range ordered SC\nstate in equilibrium. Based on these observations, the possible origins of the\nirregularly coherent charge carrier response along the $c$-axis induced by the\nphotoexcitation are discussed.",

Here, we utilized THz 2DCS\nto investigate the THz nonlinear response of conventional superconductor NbN.\nUsing broad-band THz pulses as light sources, we observed a third-order\nnonlinear signal whose spectral components are peaked at twice the\nsuperconducting gap energy $2\\Delta$. With narrow-band THz pulses, a THz\nnonlinear signal was identified at the driving frequency $\\Omega$ and exhibited\na resonant enhancement at temperature when $\\Omega = 2\\Delta$. General\ntheoretical considerations show that such a resonance can only arise from a\ndisorder-activated paramagnetic coupling between the light and the electronic\ncurrent. This proves that the nonlinear THz response can access processes\ndistinct from the diamagnetic Raman-like density fluctuations, which are\nbelieved to dominate the nonlinear response at optical frequencies in metals.\nOur numerical simulations reveal that even for a small amount of disorder, the\n$\\Omega=2\\Delta$ resonance is dominated by the superconducting amplitude mode\nover the entire investigated disorder range.

To enhance such spin-triplet contribution, it is\nexpected that junctions with a weak interfacial barrier and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling are desirable. Intuitively, a weak interfacial barrier enables a\nrobust proximity-induced superconductivity and strong spin-orbit coupling\npromotes spin mixing, converting spin-singlet into spin-triplet\nsuperconductivity. In contrast, we reveal a nonmonotonic spin-triplet\ncontribution with the strength of the interfacial barrier and spin-orbit\ncoupling. This picture is established by considering different signatures in\nconductance and superconducting correlations, as well as by performing\nself-consistent calculations. As a result, we identify a strongly enhanced\nspin-triplet superconductivity, realized for an intermediate strength of\ninterfacial barrier and spin-orbit coupling. In junctions with magnetic\nregions, an enhanced spin-triplet superconductivity leads to a large\nmagnetoanisotropy of conductance and superconducting correlations.

In these triplet superconducting spin valves, such\ncontrol usually requires inhomogeneous magnetism. However, in the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling from an interfacial heavy-metal layer, the singlet/triplet\nconversion rate and thus the critical temperature, can be controlled via the\nmagnetization direction of a single homogeneous ferromagnet.

The Co/Pt\ninterface furthest away from Nb is modified by a sub-nanometer-thick layer of\nCu or Au. We argue that the enhancement is most likely associated from an\nimprovement of the Co/Pt interface due to the insertion of Cu and Au layers.\nAdditionally, the higher normalized orbital moments in Au measured using X-ray\nmagnetic circular dichroism shows that increasing spin-orbit coupling enhances\nthe triplet proximity effect - an observation supported by our theoretical\ncalculations.
