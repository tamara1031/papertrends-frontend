As a special case of the main result, if\n$\\Gamma$ is a countable discrete abelian group, $\\varphi, \\psi \\in\nEnd(\\Gamma)$, and $\\psi - \\varphi$ is an injective endomorphism with finite\nindex image, then for any ergodic measure-preserving $\\Gamma$-system $\\left( X,\n\\mathcal{X}, \\mu, (T_g)_{g \\in \\Gamma} \\right)$, any measurable set $A \\in\n\\mathcal{X}$, and any $\\varepsilon > 0$, the set of $g \\in \\Gamma$ for which\n$$\\mu \\left( A \\cap T_{\\varphi(g)}^{-1} A \\cap T_{\\psi(g)}^{-1} A \\right) >\n\\mu(A)^3 - \\varepsilon$$ is syndetic. This generalizes the main results of\n(Ackelsberg--Bergelson--Shalom, 2022) and essentially answers a question left\nopen in that paper (Question 1.12).\n  For the group $\\Gamma = \\mathbb{Z}^d$, we deduce that for any matrices $M_1,\nM_2 \\in M_{d \\times d}(\\mathbb{Z})$ whose difference $M_2 - M_1$ is\nnonsingular, any ergodic measure-preserving $\\mathbb{Z}^d$-system $\\left( X,\n\\mathcal{X}, \\mu, (T_{\\vec{n}})_{\\vec{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d} \\right)$, any\nmeasurable set $A \\in \\mathcal{X}$, and any $\\varepsilon > 0$, the set of\n$\\vec{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$ for which $$\\mu \\left( A \\cap T_{M_1 \\vec{n}}^{-1} A\n\\cap T_{M_2 \\vec{n}}^{-1} A \\right) > \\mu(A)^3 - \\varepsilon$$ is syndetic, a\nresult that was previously known only in the case $d = 2$.\n  The key ingredients in the proof are: (1) a recent result obtained jointly\nwith Bergelson and Shalom that says that the relevant ergodic averages are\ncontrolled by a characteristic factor closely related to the quasi-affine (or\nConze--Lesigne) factor; (2) an extension trick to reduce to systems with\nwell-behaved (with respect to $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$) discrete spectrum; and (3)\na description of Mackey groups associated to quasi-affine cocycles over\nrotational systems with well-behaved discrete spectrum.",

In our methodology, the main innovation can be\nseen in the integration of deep neural networks with the neural ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) approach. Precisely, we aim at learning a neural\nnetwork that provides (approximately) an implicit representation of the data\nand an additional neural network that models the vector fields of the dependent\nvariables. We combine these two networks by constraining using neural ODEs. The\nproposed framework to learn a model describing the vector field is highly\neffective under noisy measurements.

Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant\nperspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented\nin terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all\npossible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of\nnonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction,\nestimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods\ndeveloped for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate\nsystems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear\nremains a central open challenge.

In many\napplications of data-driven modeling, e.g. biological network modeling,\ncybersecurity, modeling the Internet of Things, or smart grid monitoring, it is\nimpossible to obtain regularly sampled time-series data with a sufficiently\nhigh sampling frequency. In such situations the existing Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (DMD) or Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithms\nfor Koopman operator computation often leads to a low fidelity approximate\nKoopman operator. To this end, this paper proposes an algorithm which can\ncompute the Koopman operator efficiently when the training data-set is sparsely\nsampled across time. In particular, the proposed algorithm enriches the small\ntraining data-set by appending artificial data points, which are treated as\nnoisy observations. The larger, albeit noisy data-set is then used to compute\nthe Koopman operator, using techniques from Robust Optimization. The efficacy\nof the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated on three different dynamical\nsystems, namely a linear network of oscillators, a nonlinear system and a\ndynamical system governed by a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).",

          "abstract": "It is already well-understood that many delay differential equations with\nonly a single constant delay exhibit a change in stability according to the\nvalue of the delay in relation to a critical delay value. Finding a formula for\nthe critical delay is important to understanding the dynamics of delayed\nsystems and is often simple to obtain when the system only has a single\nconstant delay. However, if we consider a system with multiple constant delays,\nthere is no known way to obtain such a formula that determines for what values\nof the delays a change in stability occurs. In this paper, we present some\nsingle-delay approximations to a multi-delay system obtained via a Taylor\nexpansion as well as formulas for their critical delays which are used to\napproximate where the change in stability occurs in the multi-delay system. We\ndetermine when our approximations perform well and we give extra analytical and\nnumerical attention to the two-delay and three-delay settings.",

These are nonlinear parameter dependent and because of the\ntransport delay in the respiratory control system, they are modeled with delay\ndifferential equation. So, the dynamics of a two state one delay model are\ninvestigated. By choosing the delay as a parameter, the stability and Hopf\nbifurcation conditions are obtained. We notice that as the delay passes through\nits critical value, the positive equilibrium loses its stability and Hopf\nbifurcation occurs. The stable region of the system with delay against the\nother parameters and bifurcation diagrams are also plotted. The three\ndimensional stability chart of the two state model is constructed. We find that\nthe delay parameter has effect on the stability but not on the equilibrium\nstate. The explicit derivation of the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the\nstability of the bifurcation periodic solutions are determined with the help of\nnormal form theory and center manifold theorem to delay differential equations.\nFinally, some numerical example and simulations are carried out to confirm the\nanalytical findings.

In this study,\nwe extend this approach to derive positive steady states in networks under\nnon-mass-action kinetics, specifically mixed kinetics. In a system with mixed\nkinetics, some reactions {may follow} mass-action kinetics, while others in the\nsame network follow different rate laws, such as quotient rate laws. An example\nof such complexity is evident in a mathematical model of the insulin signaling\npathway in type 2 diabetes. To compute its positive {steady states}, we adapt\nour existing network decomposition approach, originally designed for\nmass-action kinetics, to handle networks with non-mass-action kinetics. This\napproach involves breaking down a given network into smaller, independent\nsubnetworks to derive the positive steady states of each subnetwork separately.\nThese individual steady states are then combined to obtain the positive steady\nstates of the entire network. This strategy makes computations more manageable\nfor complex and large networks. More importantly, this method could separate\nreactions with purely mass-action kinetics into certain subnetworks from those\nthat follow different rate laws.
