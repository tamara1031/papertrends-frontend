In this paper, we give three classes of examples of actions of\ncompact groups which have this property but do not have the Rokhlin property,\nor even finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers. One class consists of\ninfinite tensor products of finite group actions with the tracial Rokhlin\nproperty, giving actions of the product of the groups involved. The second\nclass consists of actions of the circle group on simple unital AT~algebras. The\nconstruction of the third class starts with an action of the circle on the\nCuntz algebra ${\\mathcal{O}}_{\\infty}$ which has the restricted tracial Rokhlin\nproperty with comparison; by contrast, it is known that there is no action of\nthis group on ${\\mathcal{O}}_{\\infty}$ which has finite Rokhlin dimension with\ncommuting towers. We can then tensor this action with the trivial action on any\nunital purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebra. One also gets such\nactions on certain purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras by\ntensoring the AT~examples with the trivial action on ${\\mathcal{O}}_{\\infty}$;\nthese are different.\n  We also discuss other tracial Rokhlin properties for actions of compact\ngroups, and prove that there is no direct limit action of the circle group on a\nsimple AF~algebra which even has the weakest of these properties.",

This generalization is carried out for the following\nclasses: (i) positive $\\tau$-measurable operators (affiliated with a\nsemi-finite von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace $\\tau$), (ii) positive\nelements in Haagerup's $L^p$-spaces, (iii) semi-finite normal weights on a von\nNeumann algebra.

Several results in this direction are proved, which may be of\nindependent interest. Ando studied Lebesgue decomposition for positive bounded\noperators by making use of parallel sums.
