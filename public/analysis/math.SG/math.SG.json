The main technical ingredient of our\nconstruction is a \"fiberwise wrapped\" version of the Fukaya category of a toric\nLandau-Ginzburg model. With the definition in hand, we construct a fibered\nadmissible Lagrangian submanifold whose fiberwise wrapped Floer cohomology is\nisomorphic to the ring of regular functions of the hypersurface. It follows\nthat the derived category of coherent sheaves of the hypersurface quasi-embeds\ninto the fiberwise wrapped Fukaya category of the mirror. We also discuss an\nextension to complete intersections.",

So far, in many example, the\nderived category $D^b(coh(X))$ of coherent sheaves on a toric manifold $X$ is\ncompared with the Fukaya-Seidel category of the Milnor fiber of the\ncorresponding Landau-Ginzburg potential. We instead consider the dual torus\nfibration $\\pi:M \\to B$ of the complement of the toric divisors in $X$, where\n$\\bar{B}$ is the dual polytope of the toric manifold $X$. A natural formulation\nof homological mirror symmetry in this set-up is to define $Fuk(\\bar{M})$ a\nvariant of the Fukaya category and show the equivalence $D^b(coh(X)) \\simeq\nD^b(Fuk(\\bar{M}))$. As an intermediate step, we construct the category $Mo(P)$\nof weighted Morse homotopy on $P:=\\bar{B}$ as a natural generalization of the\nweighted Fukaya-Oh category proposed by Kontsevich-Soibelman. We then show a\nfull subcategory $Mo_{\\mathcal{E}}(P)$ of $Mo(P)$ generates $D^b(coh(X))$ for\nthe cases $X$ is a complex projective space and their products.",

The\nmain directions pursued in this article are: (1) given two periodic orbits,\ndecide when they can be connected by a regular family; (2) use numerical\ninvariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the\npresence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign +/- to each elliptic or hyperbolic\nFloquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, generalizing the classical\nKrein--Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the\nabove in a visual, easily implementable and resource-efficient way. The\nmathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors, where the\n``Broucke stability diagram'' was rediscovered, but further refined with the\nabove signs, and algebraically reformulated in terms of GIT quotients of the\nsymplectic group. The advantage of the above framework is that it applies to\nthe study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. Moreover, in the\ncase where the system admits symmetries in the form of ``reflections'', i.e.\nanti-symplectic involutions, which is the case for many systems of interest,\nthe information provided for orbits which are symmetric is richer, and one may\ndistinguish more symmetric orbits.
