We\nshow that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated\ncategory has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a\nbounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also\nprove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures\non any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its\ncompletion.\n  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately\ngives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes\nanother remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded\n$t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When\nspecialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings,\nconnective $\\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc.,\nwe get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these\nresults not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in\nour sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated\ncategory, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all\nbounded $t$-structures are equivalent.

          "abstract": "Asymptotic tensor rank is notoriously difficult to determine. Indeed,\ndetermining its value for the $2\\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor would\ndetermine the matrix multiplication exponent, a long-standing open problem. On\nthe other hand, Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture makes the bold claim that\nasymptotic tensor rank equals the largest dimension of the tensor and is thus\nas easy to compute as matrix rank. Despite tremendous interest, much is still\nunknown about the structural and computational properties of asymptotic rank;\nfor instance whether it is computable.\n  We prove that asymptotic tensor rank is \"computable from above\", that is, for\nany real number $r$ there is an (efficient) algorithm that determines, given a\ntensor $T$, if the asymptotic tensor rank of $T$ is at most $r$. The algorithm\nhas a simple structure; it consists of evaluating a finite list of polynomials\non the tensor. Indeed, we prove that the sublevel sets of asymptotic rank are\nZariski-closed (just like matrix rank). While we do not exhibit these\npolynomials explicitly, their mere existence has strong implications on the\nstructure of asymptotic rank.\n  As one such implication, we find that the values that asymptotic tensor rank\ntakes, on all tensors, is a well-ordered set. In other words, any\nnon-increasing sequence of asymptotic ranks stabilizes (\"discreteness from\nabove\"). In particular, for the matrix multiplication exponent (which is an\nasymptotic rank) there is no sequence of exponents of bilinear maps that\napproximates it arbitrarily closely from above without being eventually\nconstant. In other words, any upper bound on the matrix multiplication exponent\nthat is close enough, will \"snap\" to it. Previously such discreteness results\nwere only known for finite fields or for other tensor parameters (e.g.,\nasymptotic slice rank). We obtain them for infinite fields like the complex\nnumbers.",

They are a rich set of functions that includes polynomials\nthemselves, but also ratios and radicals, and finite compositions thereof. When\nan algebraic program is given in terms of radical expressions, a\nstraightforward way of reformulating into a polynomial program is to introduce\na new variable for each distinct radical that appears. Hence, the rich theory\nand algorithms for polynomial programs, including satisfiability via\ncylindrical algebraic decomposition, infeasibility certificates via\nPositivstellensatz theorems, and optimization with sum-of-squares programming\ndirectly apply to algebraic programs. We propose a different reformulation,\nthat in many cases introduces significantly fewer new variables, and thus\nproduces polynomial programs that are easier to solve. First, we exhibit an\nalgorithm that finds a defining polynomial of an algebraic function given as a\nradical expression. As a polynomial does not in general define a unique\nalgebraic function, additional constraints need to be added that isolate the\nalgebraic function from others defined by the same polynomial. Using results\nfrom real algebraic geometry, we develop an algorithm that generates polynomial\ninequalities that isolate an algebraic function. This allows us to reformulate\nan algebraic program into a polynomial one, by introducing only a single new\nvariable for each algebraic function.

The automorphism groups of such varieties are\nnonlinear and contain the braid group $B_n$ on $n$ strands for $n\\geqslant 3$,\nand are nonamenable for $n\\geqslant 2$. As an application, it is proved that\nfor $n\\geqslant 3$, every Cremona group of rank $\\geqslant 3n-1$ contains the\ngroups ${\\rm Aut}(F_n)$ and $B_n$. This bound is 1 better than the one\npublished earlier by the author; with respect to $B_n$ the order of its growth\nrate is one less than that of the bound following from the paper by D.

Using this result,\nwe show that the automorphism group detects sphericity and the weight-monoid.\n  As an application, we show that an affine toric variety different from an\nalgebraic torus is determined by its automorphism group among normal\nirreducible affine varieties and we show that a smooth affine spherical variety\ndifferent from an algebraic torus is determined by its automorphism group (up\nto an automorphism of the base field) among smooth irreducible affine\nvarieties.",
