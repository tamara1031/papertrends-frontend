A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether\ndark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in\nconstraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest\nobservational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a\ncomparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current\ndata. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon\nacoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong\ngravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC), deviance information criterion (DIC), and Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC and DIC analyses\nindicate that all dark energy models outperform the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nHowever, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier\npenalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy\nmodels are robustly supported by AIC and DIC while being explicitly disfavored\nby BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and DIC and not explicitly\ndisfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark\nenergy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity\nmodel exhibits superior performance when compared with $\\Lambda$CDM across all\ninformation criteria.",

It\nis observed that for both the models, the equation of state parameter\napproaches to $-1$ at late times. However, the RHDE model with the Hubble\nhorizon exhibits stability from the squared sound speed, but the RHDE model\nwith the GO horizon exhibits instability.

We then\ninvestigate whether two minimal extensions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, together\nor separately, can successfully realize such a scenario: (i) the spatial\ncurvature, which, in the case of spatially closed universe, mimics a negative\ndensity source and (ii) simple-graduated dark energy (gDE), which promotes the\nnull inertial mass density of the usual vacuum energy to an arbitrary\nconstant--if negative, the corresponding energy density decreases with redshift\nsimilar to the phantom models, but unlike them crosses below zero at a certain\nredshift. We find that, when the Planck data are not included in the\nobservational analysis, the models with simple-gDE predict interesting and some\nsignificant deviations from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, a spatially\nclosed universe along with a simple-gDE of positive inertial mass density,\nwhich work in contrast to each other, results in minor improvement to the $H_0$\ntension. The joint dataset, including the Planck data, presents no evidence for\na deviation from spatial flatness but almost the same evidence for a\ncosmological constant and the simple-gDE with an inertial mass density of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})\\,\\rm eV^4$. The latter case predicts almost no deviation\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM model up until today--so that it results in no\nimprovement regarding the BAO Ly-$\\alpha$ data--except that it slightly\naggravates the $H_0$ tension.

However, the presence of matter and the high mass ratio makes\ngenerating long and accurate waveforms from these systems hard to do with\nnumerical relativity, and not much is known about systematic uncertainties due\nto waveform modeling. We simulate gravitational waves from neutron star black\nhole mergers by hybridizing numerical relativity waveforms produced with the\nSpEC code with a recent numerical relativity surrogate NRHybSur3dq8Tidal. These\nsignals are analyzed using a range of available waveform families, and\nstatistical and systematic errors are reported. We find that at a network\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30, statistical uncertainties are usually larger\nthan systematic offsets, while at an SNR of 70 the two become comparable. The\nindividual black hole and neutron star masses, as well as the mass ratios, are\ntypically measured very precisely, though not always accurately at high SNR. At\na SNR of 30 the neutron star tidal deformability can only be bound from above,\nwhile for louder sources it can be measured and constrained away from zero. All\nneutron stars in our simulations are non-spinning, but in no case we can\nconstrain the neutron star spin to be smaller than $\\sim0.4$ (90% credible\ninterval).

          "abstract": "The black hole shadow, first observed by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017,\nis the newest method for studying black holes and understanding gravity. Much\nwork has gone into understanding the shadow of a Kerr black hole, including all\nof the complex astrophysics of the accretion disk, and there are numerous\nstudies of the ideal shadow in non-Kerr black holes and exotic compact objects.\nThis paper presents one of the first studies of the black hole shadow of\nnon-Kerr black holes when the illumination source is an accretion disk. In\nparticular, the ability of current and future very long baseline interformeters\nto estimate the physical parameters of the black hole spacetime and accretion\ndisk is investigated using two different parametrized black hole metrics that\nencode a number of possible deviations from Kerr. Both the full shadow image\nand the individual subrings of the shadow are analyzed as the higher order\nsubrings are weakly dependent on the disk physics and may be a more viable\nobservable for studying the spacetime. The results suggest that with current\ntelescope capabilities and any future earth-based telescopes it will be quite\ndifficult to place strong constraints on departures from the Kerr spacetime,\nprimarily due to the low resolution and strong degeneracies between the\nspacetime parameters. More optimistically, space-based interferometers may be\ncapable of testing the Kerr nature of black holes and general relativity to\ncomparable or better precision than is currently possible with other\nobservations.",

To study the photon sphere, quasinormal\nmodes, and black hole shadow, we employ various techniques such as the WKB\nmethod in various orders of approximation, the Poschl-Teller potential method,\nand Churilova's analytical formulas.

In particular, the apparently ambiguous spin Casimir terms can be\nfully determined from the gradient of the spin-diagonal part of the amplitudes\nwith respect to $S^2 = -s(s+1)\\hbar^2$, using an interpolation between massive\namplitudes with different spin representations. From two-loop amplitudes of\nspin-0 and spin-1 particles minimally coupled to gravity, we extract the spin\nCasimir terms in the conservative scattering angle between a spinless and a\nspinning black hole at $\\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$, finding agreement with known\nresults in the literature. This completes an earlier study [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n130 (2023), 021601] that calculated the non-Casimir terms from amplitudes. We\nalso illustrate our methods using a model of spinning bodies in\nelectrodynamics, finding agreement between scattering amplitude predictions and\nclassical predictions in a root-Kerr electromagnetic background up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^3 S^2)$. For both gravity and electrodynamics, the finite\npart of the amplitude coincides with the two-body radial action in the aligned\nspin limit, generalizing the amplitude-action relation beyond the spinless\ncase. Surprisingly, the two-loop amplitude displays a hidden spin-shift\nsymmetry in the probe limit, which was previously observed at one loop. We\nconjecture that the symmetry holds to all orders in the coupling constant and\nis a consequence of integrability of Kerr orbits in the probe limit at the\nfirst few orders in spin.",
