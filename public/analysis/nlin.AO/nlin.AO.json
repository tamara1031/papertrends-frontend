Nevertheless, there is an increasing\nevidence, also supported by available data, that complex systems are composed\nby multiple units experiencing many-body interactions, that can be modeled by\nusing higher-order structures beyond the paradigm of classic pairwise networks.\nIn this work we investigate whether phase chimera states appear in this\nframework, by focusing on a novel topology solely involving many-body,\nnon-local and non-regular interactions, hereby named non-local d-hyperring,\nbeing (d+1) the order of the interactions. We present the theory by using the\nparadigmatic Stuart-Landau oscillators as node dynamics, and show that phase\nchimera states emerge in a variety of structures and with different coupling\nfunctions.

In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active\nparticles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose\ntoward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with\nrobotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form\nmicelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance\nwith a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov and A. Borisov, Presentations\nand Videos to 7th Edition of the International Conference on Particle-based\nMethods (2021), Vol. CT07, p. 2]. Such a behavior is observed for both\nnonchiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for\nchiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By\nperforming experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil\nthat the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots'\ncenter of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle\neffects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot\nclusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation\nprobability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral\nsurfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve\nany solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is\ninstead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.",

Very much like their natural\ncounterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate\ncollective motion such that controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging.\nHere, we demonstrate a novel yet simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear\nelasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures\ncapable of directed motion and other emergent intelligent behaviors. Our\nelasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots\nconnected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to\nbuckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the\nphysics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use\nreduced order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structure\nwith boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can\nexhibit intelligent behaviors such as maze navigation.

          "abstract": "Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature; groups of animals, such as fish,\nbirds, and ungulates appear to move as a whole, exhibiting a rich behavioral\nrepertoire that ranges from directed movement to milling to disordered\nswarming. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local\ninteractions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school).\nPreeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled\nparticles, subject to self-generated motion and 'social forces' such as\nshort-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However,\norganisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we\nintroduce an approach to modelling collective behavior based on active\ninference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a\nsingle imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many\nempirically-observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling and\ndirected motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active\nBayesian inference -- without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals\ninto individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover\nand generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to\nsuppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring\nthe parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal non-trivial\nrelationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like\npolarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also\nexplore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective\ndecision-making accuracy.

          "abstract": "Pulse-coupled spiking neural networks are a powerful tool to gain mechanistic\ninsights into how neurons self-organize to produce coherent collective\nbehavior. These networks use simple spiking neuron models, such as the\n$\\theta$-neuron or the quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neuron, that\nreplicate the essential features of real neural dynamics. Interactions between\nneurons are modeled with infinitely narrow pulses, or spikes, rather than the\nmore complex dynamics of real synapses. To make these networks biologically\nmore plausible, it has been proposed that they must also account for the finite\nwidth of the pulses, which can have a significant impact on the network\ndynamics. However, the derivation and interpretation of these pulses is\ncontradictory and the impact of the pulse shape on the network dynamics is\nlargely unexplored. Here, I take a comprehensive approach to pulse-coupling in\nnetworks of QIF and $\\theta$-neurons. I argue that narrow pulses activate\nvoltage-dependent synaptic conductances and show how to implement them in QIF\nneurons such that their effect can last through the phase after the spike.\nUsing an exact low-dimensional description for networks of globally coupled\nspiking neurons, I prove for instantaneous interactions that collective\noscillations emerge due to an effective coupling through the mean voltage. I\nanalyze the impact of the pulse shape by means of a family of smooth pulse\nfunctions with arbitrary finite width and symmetric or asymmetric shapes. For\nsymmetric pulses, the resulting voltage-coupling is not very effective in\nsynchronizing neurons, but pulses that are slightly skewed to the phase after\nthe spike readily generate collective oscillations. The results unveil a\nvoltage-dependent spike synchronization mechanism in neural networks, which is\nfacilitated by pulses of finite width and complementary to traditional synaptic\ntransmission.",

          "abstract": "Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism taking\ninto account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of\nthe firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on\nthe macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying\npost-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population\nactivities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next\ngeneration neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the\nderivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible\nmacroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled\nneural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population\nbursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for\ninhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of\nadaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken\nsymmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase\npopulation spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new\ncollective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among\nthe fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from\nanti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting\nphenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the $\\theta$-$\\gamma$ range has\nrevealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the $\\theta$ frequency\njoined to a decrease of the $\\gamma$ one.

We have also investigated the consequence of\nreplacing the usual Gaussian self-frequencies to exponential distributed ones,\ndescribing renewable energy sources. We found a drop in the steady state\nsynchronization averages, but the cascade size distribution both for the US and\nHungarian systems remained insensitive and have kept the universal tails,\ncharacterized by the exponent $\\tau\\simeq 1.8$.

          "abstract": "Decarbonization in the energy sector has been accompanied by an increased\npenetration of new renewable energy sources in electric power systems. Such\nsources differ from traditional productions in that, first, they induce larger,\nundispatchable fluctuations in power generation and second, they lack inertia.\nTherefore, substituting new renewables for traditional generation induces\nstronger and more frequent disturbances and modifies the way disturbances\npropagate across AC electric power grids. Recent measurements have indeed\nreported long, non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of local grid-frequency\ndata. Large frequency deviations may induce grid instabilities, leading in\nworst-case scenarios to cascading failures and large-scale blackouts. In this\nmanuscript, we investigate how correlated noise disturbances, characterized by\nthe cumulants of their distribution, propagate through meshed, high-voltage\npower grids. We show that for a single source of fluctuations,\nnon-Gaussianities in the form of finite skewness and positive kurtosis of the\nnoise distribution propagate over the entire network when the noise correlation\ntime is larger than the network's intrinsic time scales, but that they vanish\nover short distances if the noise fluctuates rapidly. We furthermore show that\na Berry-Esseen theorem leads to the vanishing of non-Gaussianities as the\nnumber of uncorrelated noise sources increases. Our results show that the\npersistence of non-Gaussian fluctuations of feed-in power have a global impact\non power-grid dynamics when they fluctuate over time scales larger than the\nintrinsic time scales of the system, which, we argue, is the relevant regime in\nreal power grids.

          "abstract": "Cascade failures in power grids occur when the failure of one component or\nsubsystem causes a chain reaction of failures in other components or\nsubsystems, ultimately leading to a widespread blackout or outage. Controlling\ncascade failures on power grids is important for many reasons like economic\nimpact, national security, public safety and even rippled effects like\ntroubling transportation systems. Monitoring the networks on node level has\nbeen suggested by many, either controlling all nodes of a network or by\nsubsets. This study identifies sensitive graph elements of the weighted\nEuropean power-grids (from 2016, 2022) by two different methods. Bridges are\ndetermined between communities and \"weak\" nodes are selected by the lowest\nlocal synchronization of the swing equation. In the latter case we add bypasses\nof the same number as the bridges at weak nodes, and we compare the\nsynchronization, cascade failure behavior by the dynamical improvement with the\npurely topological changes. The results are also compared if bridges are\nremoved from networks, which results in a case similar to islanding, and with\nthe addition of links at randomly selected places. Bypassing was found to\nimprove synchronization the best, while the average cascade sizes are the\nlowest with bridge additions. However, for very large or small global couplings\nthese network changes do not help, they seem to be useful near the\nsynchronization transition region, where self-organization drives the\npower-grid. Thus, we provide a demonstration for the Braess' Paradox on\ncontinent-sized power grid simulations and uncover the limitations of this\nphenomenon. We also determine the cascade size distributions and justify the\npower-law tails near the transition point on these grids.",

This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is\nespecially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free\nenergy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical\nsystems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a\nparsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it\ndoes, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using\nthe FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of\nvariational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a\nLyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative\nmodels to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a\nparticular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory\nenables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among\nsubsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the\nFEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the\nliteral sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the\n`explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy\ngradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.",

In our \"neighborhood BCMs\" (NBCMs), interacting agents are\ninfluenced both by each other's opinions and by the opinions of the agents in\neach other's neighborhoods. Our NBCMs thus include both the usual dyadic\ninfluence between agents and a \"transitive influence\", which encodes the\ninfluence of an agent's neighbors, when determining whether or not an\ninteraction changes the opinions of agents. In this transitive influence, an\nindividual's opinion is influenced by a neighbor when, on average, the opinions\nof the neighbor's neighbors are sufficiently similar to its own opinion. We\nformulate both neighborhood Deffuant--Weisbuch (NDW) and neighborhood\nHegselmann--Krause (NHK) BCMs.\n  We build further on our NBCMs by introducing a neighborhood-based network\nadaptation in which a network coevolves with agent opinions by changing its\nstructure through \"transitive homophily\". In this network evolution, an agent\nbreaks a tie to one of its neighbors and then rewires that tie to a new agent,\nwith a preference for agents with a mean neighbor opinion that is closer to its\nown opinion.
