The domains are\nobtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely\nuniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship\nto construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues.\n  In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that\nKokarev's upper bound of $8\\pi$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov\neigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other\ntopological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the\nbest upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the\nfirst two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising\nconsequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the\nunit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than\n$2\\pi$. This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical\nevidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal\nsurfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free\nboundary minimal surfaces of genus 0 in the unit ball with even larger area.\nThe first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a\nconsequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they verify a general\nconjecture by Fraser and Li.\n  In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of\nColbois--El Soufi--Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted\nLaplace eigenvalues. We also show that in any manifold with a fixed metric, one\ncan construct by varying the weight a domain with connected boundary whose\nfirst nonzero normalised Steklov eigenvalue is arbitrarily large.",

However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra\nand infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral\ninformation a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven\nalgorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral\ninformation of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual\ndynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for\ncomputing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from\nsnapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and\nResDMD, we compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with\ngeneral measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence\ntheorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for\nchaotic systems when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the\ndiscrete spectrum. Since our algorithms come with error control, ResDMD allows\naposteri verification of spectral quantities, Koopman mode decompositions, and\nlearned dictionaries. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, circle\nrotations, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, and Lorenz\nsystem. Finally, we provide kernelized variants of our algorithms for dynamical\nsystems with a high-dimensional state space.
