We show how GG-convex conjugation can be axiomatized in the spirit\nof the notion of general duality transforms introduced in [2,3].\n  We then move to the study of GG-convex risk measures, which are defined as\nGG-convex functionals defined on suitable spaces of random variables. We derive\na general dual representation that extends analogous expressions presented in\n[4] under the additional assumptions of monotonicity and positive homogeneity.\nAs a prominent example, we study the family of Orlicz risk measures.

The\ncompany allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders\nwhile strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting\ndividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The\nirreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot\nbe prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate level\nand the reinsurance level are modelled as nondecreasing processes, thereby\nsatisfying the constraints. The incurred claims are modelled via a Brownian\nrisk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected\ndiscounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and\ndividend levels belong to either a finite set or a closed interval. The optimal\nvalue functions for the finite set case and the closed interval case are proved\nto be the unique viscosity solutions of the corresponding\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and the convergence between these optimal\nvalue functions is established. For the finite set case, a threshold strategy\nis proved to be optimal, while for the closed interval case, an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal strategy is constructed.

The problem formulation considered in this paper is closely\nconnected to the optimal portfolio problem in finance, with some crucial\ndistinctions. In particular, the insurance company's surplus is here (as is\nroutinely the case) approximated by a Brownian motion, as opposed to the\ngeometric Brownian motion used to model assets in finance. Furthermore, risk\nexposure is dialled \"down\" via reinsurance, rather than \"up\" via risky\ninvestments. This leads to interesting qualitative differences in the optimal\ndesigns.\n  In this paper, using the martingale method, we derive the optimal design as a\nfunction of proportional, non-cheap reinsurance design that maximises the\nquadratic utility of the terminal value of the insurance surplus. We also\nconsider several realistic constraints on the terminal value: a strict lower\nboundary, the probability (Value at Risk) constraint, and the expected\nshortfall (conditional Value at Risk) constraints under the $\\mathbb{P}$ and\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ measures, respectively.

          "abstract": "With the development of the financial industry, credit default prediction, as\nan important task in financial risk management, has received increasing\nattention. Traditional credit default prediction methods mostly rely on machine\nlearning models, such as decision trees and random forests, but these methods\nhave certain limitations in processing complex data and capturing potential\nrisk patterns. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on\nthe combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer for\ncredit user default prediction. The model combines the advantages of CNN in\nlocal feature extraction with the ability of Transformer in global dependency\nmodeling, effectively improving the accuracy and robustness of credit default\nprediction. Through experiments on public credit default datasets, the results\nshow that the CNN+Transformer model outperforms traditional machine learning\nmodels, such as random forests and XGBoost, in multiple evaluation indicators\nsuch as accuracy, AUC, and KS value, demonstrating its powerful ability in\ncomplex financial data modeling. Further experimental analysis shows that\nappropriate optimizer selection and learning rate adjustment play a vital role\nin improving model performance. In addition, the ablation experiment of the\nmodel verifies the advantages of the combination of CNN and Transformer and\nproves the complementarity of the two in credit default prediction. This study\nprovides a new idea for credit default prediction and provides strong support\nfor risk assessment and intelligent decision-making in the financial field.\nFuture research can further improve the prediction effect and generalization\nability by introducing more unstructured data and improving the model\narchitecture.",

The ERP setup of Marzban et al. (2020) is\nconsidered where residual hedging risk is quantified with convex risk measures.\nThe main objective of this paper is to assess through extensive numerical\nexperiments the impact of including options as hedging instruments within the\nERP framework. The reinforcement learning procedure developed in Carbonneau and\nGodin (2020), which relies on the deep hedging algorithm of Buehler et al.\n(2019b), is applied to numerically solve the global hedging problems by\nrepresenting trading policies with neural networks. Among other findings,\nnumerical results indicate that in the presence of jump risk, hedging long-term\nputs with shorter-term options entails a significant decrease of both equal\nrisk prices and market incompleteness as compared to trading only the stock.\nMonte Carlo experiments demonstrate the potential of ERP as a fair valuation\napproach providing prices consistent with observable market prices. Analyses\nexhibit the ability of ERP to span a large interval of prices through the\nchoice of convex risk measures which is close to encompass the variance-optimal\npremium.",

Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight\nrisks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity\nshocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently\ndue to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability\nin DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how\ndisruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political\ndevelopments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing\ninterdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance\nof understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually,\nbut also at their intersection.

We examine the\nshortcomings of this PD-comparison approach and propose an alternative\nframework for generating SICR-definitions based on three parameters:\ndelinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period. Having varied these framework\nparameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit logistic regression\nmodels accordingly using rich South African mortgage and macroeconomic data.\nFor each definition and corresponding model, the resulting SICR-rates are\nanalysed at the portfolio-level on their stability over time and their\nresponsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we compare both the\naccuracy and dynamicity of the SICR-predictions, and discover several\ninteresting trends and trade-offs. These results can help any bank with\nappropriately setting the three framework parameters in defining SICR-events\nfor prediction purposes. We demonstrate this process by comparing the\nbest-performing SICR-model to the PD-comparison approach, and show the latter's\ninferiority as an early-warning system. Our work can therefore guide the\nformulation, modelling, and testing of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting\nthe timeous recognition of credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.",

Using South African mortgage data, we explore both\nthe Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time\nmodels. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores\nrecurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model.

While the TFD- and PWP-models do not\ndiffer significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed\nexpectations. Depending on the prevalence of recurrent defaults, one may\ntherefore safely ignore them when estimating lifetime default risk.\nAccordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in\nproducing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.",
